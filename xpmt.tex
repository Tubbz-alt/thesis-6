This chapter covers the implementation details, experiments performed,
and results obtained from the experimental apparatus built for this
project.

\section{Design of the experimental apparatus}

\subsection{Overview of the experimental rig}

The experimental apparatus that was designed and built as part of this project
is shown as a schematic in \figref{rig} and as a photograph in
\figref{rig-photo}. Physical parameters of the design are shown in
\tabref{rigprop}. The experimental rig was built to serve as a platform for
investigating the dynamics of a simple system supported by magnets with
varying stiffnesses; specifically, for demonstrating a specific case of
the ideas behind the \qzs/ arrangement analysed in detail in \secref{qzs}.

The rig therefore consists of an arrangement of magnets, of which two are
fixed to the frame; `floating' magnets are supported by these of which one
is situated below to apply a repulsive force (positive stiffness) and the
other is situated above to apply an attractive force (negative stiffness). The
physical location of the fixed magnets may be moved vertically in order to
vary the respective amounts of positive and negative stiffness.

The magnet system is designed to look at dynamics in the vertical displacement
direction; having stability in this direction implies instability in the
horizontal direction (as discussed in \secref{earnshaw}). In order to remain
stable, the magnets require a physical constraint, achieved by placing the
floating magnets at the end of a long pinned rigid beam. Small rotations of
this beam can be assumed to correspond to largely vertical displacements of
the end magnets. This is ensured in the design later in
\secref{rotating-beam}.

The beam itself was chosen as a hollow rectangular section in order to
minimise weight and maximise stiffness; it is assumed to be a rigid body
for the purposes of these experiments (especially at the low vibrational
frequencies under investigation).

Having a physical constraint on the motion of the floating magnets compromises
the non-contact idea of using magnets for vibration isolation. This
experimental rig has been designed to analyse the behaviour of the system in
terms of vertical translational disturbances. For a completely non-contact
system, a control system with electromagnets may be used to apply the
horizontal constraint (also see \secref{coupling}).

\subsection{Magnets}

The magnets used for the experimental apparatus were chosen based on ease of
availability and construction. Cylindrical magnets were used of dimensions
$\mbox{\diameter}\,\SI{12.7}{mm}\times\SI{9.5}{mm}$ and material properties as
shown in \tabref{magnet-prop}.

\begin{table}
  \caption{Material properties for the magnets in the experimental apparatus.
    Magnet properties taken as minimum grade values from \KJMagnetics/.}
  \tablabel{magnet-prop}
  \begin{tabular}{@{}ll@{}}
    \toprule
    Diameter & \SI{12.7}{mm} \\
    Height   & \SI{9.5}{mm}  \\
    Grade    & \acro{N42} \\
    Remanence & \SI{1.3}{T} \\
    Intrinsic coercivity & \SI{960}{kA/m} \\
    Maximum energy product & \SI{325}{kJ/m^3} \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Cylindrical magnets were chosen for their ease of integration into the
construction of the rig; \eg, it is much easier to fix a cylindrical magnet
into an object by boring a round hole as opposed to milling a square one.

\begin{comment}
A cylindrical magnet with slightly greater diameter than height was chosen in
order to match the force \vs\ distance characteristic with that of a cuboid
magnet; it can be shown that the force between two inline magnets is the same
for both cube shapes of a certain height and for cylinders with that same
height and equal face area, such as shown in \figref{equal-area}.

\begin{figure}
  \asyfig{Magnets/equal-area}
  \caption{A circle and square of equal area (to scale).}
  \figlabel{equal-area}
\end{figure}

For cylindrical magnet of diameter \SI{12.7}{mm}, the side length required to
achieve the same force curve as a cube magnet is \SI{11.3}{mm}, which is
somewhat larger than that of the actual magnet sourced for the apparatus.
However, it is was as close as possible to the desired size, and other factors
involved in the design (misalignment of the magnet centres, for example) will
act to reduce the total force slightly. For the purposes of the later
simulations, the magnetic forces will be assumed to be
generated by cube magnets of side length \SI{9.5}{mm}.
\end{comment}

\subsection{Actuators}
\seclabel{actuators}

to highlight the dynamics of the magnetic support as much as possible, any
additional actuators for applying control forces should affect the dynamics of
the system as little as possible. Fitting with the theme of non-contact
support, a non-contact actuator should be chosen if possible. An
electromagnetic force was the obvious choice to satisfy these requirements.

Electromagnetic actuators are usually designed in push-pull configurations,
with fixed non-biased coils applying force on a moving ferrous material. Since
only attractive forces can be generated in this configuration, such
electromagnets must be used in pairs to achieve forces in two directions.

An alternative is to used biased electromagnets, such that either the coil
itself contains a permanent magnet, or the coil acts against a permanent
magnet, or both. For a biased coil, instability results due to the presence of
the negative stiffness attractive forces between the permanent magnet and the
ferrous moving material. In these cases, pairs of electromagnets are no longer
strictly necessary since the current in the coil may be reversed and a
repulsive force generated.

For example, \textcite{nandi2009} demonstrate a single-sided design in which a
bias current is used to keep the structure in permanently `sprung' position;
relaxing the current is the equivalent of a repulsive force, while increasing
the current is the usual `pull' or attractive force of a regular
electromagnetic actuator. This design is relatively inefficient since it
requires a continuous energy expenditure to remain in equilibrium.

Using a non-ferrous coil to apply forces to a moving permanent magnet,
however, is passively stable and requires no steady current for operation.
However, the forces applied by a coil to an external magnet are relatively
small; larger forces are achieved when the magnet can be inserted within the
coil itself. This suits a secondary requirement for the electromagnetic
actuator to keep it inline with the load-bearing magnets, and is suitable for a
future application of such an arrangement for an apparatus built to support
multiple degrees of freedom. The ferrous-free coil and moving permanent magnet
approach was adopted for the choice of electromagnetic actuator for the rig,
as has already been shown in the schematic \figref[vref]{rig}.

The dual-coil electromagnetic arrangement described in \secref{dualcoil} was
custom-built for the actuator for the experimental apparatus. A schematic of
the dual coil is shown in \figref{rig-dual-coil} with parameters in
\tabref{coil-prop}. The coil was designed to have an impedance of
\SI{8}{\ohm}, from which the outer radius of the coil was calculated given a
certain wire diameter and resistance.

\end{sidefigure}
  \end{wide}
\end{figure}

    Coil gap & $\GapCoil$ & \SI{7}{mm} \\
    Turns (approx.) & & \num{105} \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The dimensions of the coil were chosen based on the trends shown in the
analytical calculations from \secref{dualcoil}. A force \vs\  displacement
curve of this particuar coil is shown in \figref{2coils-normdesign}; from this
graph, it can be seen that around the centred position (displacement of zero
in the curve), the force imparted by the coil remains within 10\% of maximum
around a displacement range of around \SI{\pm2}{mm}.

\subsection{Sensors}
\seclabel{xpmt-sensors}

The requirements for the sensing equipment is similar to that of the actuators; noncontact spatial measurement is desired to remove any possibility of adding further dynamics to the system.
A displacement sensor is required to calibrate the position of the fixed and moving magnets in the system.
Velocity sensors are used for feedback control to add damping to the system (see \secref[vref]{skyhook}) in order to aid the vibration isolation characteristic of the system.
Accelerometers are used to measure the vibration response on the beam and on the base.

\subsubsection{Displacement sensors}

There are five main choices for non-contact distance sensing,
enumerated below. See \textcite{boehm1993} for a more detailed overview.
\begin{description}

\item[Ultrasonic]

    These sensors work by sending out modulated
    ultra-sonic pulses to be reflected off the target. The time spent
    in the round trip gives a linear indicator of the
    distance. Of the sensors described here, ultrasonic is the only one
    that is unsuitable due to low accuracy and frequency response.

\item[Inductive]

    An inductive, or Hall effect, sensor works by exciting a coil with a high
    frequency sinusoidal current which induces eddy currents in the target.
    \note{An example of a commercial inductive sensor is
          \url{http://www.microstrain.com/ncdvrt.aspx}}
    These eddy currents may be measured very accurately, but the whole effect
    is very dependent on a lack of magnetic noise. This makes these type of
    sensors difficult to use in magnetic applications.

\item[Capacitive]

    A capacitive sensor measures the capacitance between a plate and the
    target. \note{An example of a commerical capacitive sensor is
    \url{http://www.micro-epsilon.com/products/displacement-position-sensors/capacitive-sensor/capaNCDT_6019/index.html}.}
    To measure large distances, however, a large capacitive head is
    required (approx.\ $1$\,cm diameter for every $1$\,mm of range
    \fxfatal{citation required}).

\item[Linear Variable Differential Transformer]

    `\acro{lvdt}' sensors use a moving probe attached to an electrical
    circuit that exhibits a measureable effect which varies with displacement
    of the probe.
    \note{An example of a commercial \acro{lvdt} sensor is
          \url{http://www.microstrain.com/dvrt.aspx}.}
    Differential Variable Reluctance Transducers
    (`\textsc{dvrt}') are a variation on this idea. The probe must either be
    fixed to the measured object or be pressed against it with a positive
    spring force. Non-contact operation is only possible for linear
    displacements in a single translational direction.

\item[Laser]

    A laser sensor uses interferometry of a reflected laser signal to
    calculate the absolute displacement of the target from the sensor.
    \note{An example of a commerical laser displacement sensor is
          \url{http://tinyurl.com/wenglor}.}
    These sensors have the advantage of being unaffected by electrical or
    magnetic noise and robust working environment against any surface (albeit
    with a suitable finish).

\end{description}

The sensor purchased for the experimental apparatus was a Wenglor 05\,MGV\,80
opto-electronic sensor, which uses a laser to measure distance over a
range of \SI{10}{mm}. It was selected for its convenient availability,
flexibility of application, and good performance characteristics.
Relevant operating properties are listed in \tabref{wenglor}.

\begin{table}
  \caption{Some properties of the Wenglor~05\,MGV\,80 laser distance sensor.}
  \tablabel{wenglor}
  \begin{tabular}{@{}ll@{}}
    \toprule
    Measurement offset & \SI{43}{mm} \\
    Measurement range & \SI{10}{mm} \\
    \midrule
    Working range & \SI{43}{mm}--\SI{53}{mm} \\
    Output range & \SI{10}{V}--\SI{0}{V} \\
    \midrule
    Resolution & $<\SI{10}{\micro m}$ \\
    Response time & \SI{0.5}{ms} \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The measured output of the sensor was used infer a magnet displacement, \DispMag, (referenced from the \qzs/ position) with the following transformation:
\begin{dmath}
  \DispMag\fn{\DisplSensor,\OriginMagHigh} =
    \OriginMagDisp\fn{\DisplSensor} - \OriginQZS\fn{\OriginMagHigh}
\end{dmath},
where $\OriginQZS$ is the height of the \qzs/ location, given by
\begin{dmath}
  \OriginQZS\fn{\OriginMagHigh} = \half\gp{\HeightRig-\OriginMagLow-\OriginMagHigh-\HeightRigMagnets}
\end{dmath},
and the displacement of the magnets $\OriginMagDisp$ is
\begin{dmath}
  \OriginMagDisp\fn{\DisplSensor} = \OriginBeam + \DisplSensorBeam\fn{\DisplSensor} {\cdot} \LengthRigMagnets/\LengthSensor - \HeightBeam + \ThicknessBeam + \half \HeightRigMagnets
\end{dmath},
where $\DisplSensorBeam$ is the vertical displacement measured at the position
of the sensor, given by
\begin{dmath}
  \DisplSensorBeam\fn{\DisplSensor} = \gp{\HeightRig - \OriginBeam} - \HeightSensor - \DisplSensor
\end{dmath}

\subsubsection{Velocity sensors}

As velocity is defined in terms of a change in displacement from some reference point, it is only meaningful to refer to the velocity of an object with respect to an inertial reference frame.
With a sensor attached to the ground, separate from the object, relative velocity can be measured between the disturbance and the resulting excitation ($\velMass-\velBase$ in terms of \figref{simple-isolation}).
Laser sensors
    \note{Also known as vibrometers, such as sold by Polytec GmbH: \url{http://www.polytec.com/}}
and capacitive sensors \cite{nijsse2001} may be used to measure relative velocity directly, while relative velocity may be estimated by differentiating the output of a displacement sensor.
Such estimation is prone to high frequency noise that must be filtered away.

Absolute velocity sensors must use more complex physical processes to obtain a measure of an object with respect to the `fixed' earth.
Absolute angular velocity can be infered by measuring the coriolis force induced on a vibrating element due to the rotational energy of the earth \cite{konno1996}.
A geophone uses a moving magnet or moving coil arrangement to generate \backemf/ from the motion of an inertial mass \cite{oome2009-saa} from which absolute velocity can be calculated.
This process is limited in the low frequency by the resonance frequency of the inertial mass and in the high frequency by the roll-off of the frequency response.
Absolute translational velocity can be estimated by integrating a measured acceleration; this technique (which is used in the experimental apparatus) is discussed in the next section.

\subsubsection{Acceleration sensors}

For the beam, a \BnK/ 4367 accelerometer was used to measure the `output' signal; for the base, a 4332 accelerometer measured the `input' signal of the system. Technical specifications, including charge amplifier and filters used, are shown in \tabref{rig-apparatus}.

\begin{table}
  \begin{tabular}{@{}ll@{}}
    \toprule
      Base accelerometer & \BnK/ 4367 \\
      Floating accelerometer & \BnK/ 4332 \\
      Charge Amplifiers & \BnK/ 2635 \\
      Low-pass filters & 0000 \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Experimental apparatus used for signal measurement and filtering.}
  \tablabel{rig-apparatus}
\end{table}

For open loop measurements, these sensors were used to measure acceleration directly; for closed loop control, the charge amplifier was used to integrate the measured signals and estimate the velocities.
Standard methods for interpreting the accelerometer involve high-pass filtering the measured signal to avoid drift as integration errors accumulate.
The corner frequency for the integration must be reasonably high, as it is not possible to distinguish between drift and low frequency components in the  signal.
An alternative is the use of `drift-free' integrators \cite{gavin1998}, in which the drift is compensated for using alternative signal processing methods, but this approach is only advantageous for measuring low-frequency periodic signals; for transient or wide-band signals, the typical approach is better suited.

As an alternative, low frequency velocity signals can be estimated by differentiating a displacement measurement.
If the displacement sensor is fixed to a fixed inertial reference frame, then this estimate may be combined with an integrated accelerometer measurement to obtain a more accurate estimate of the velocity \cite{bennett2007}.
However, if relative displacement is measured between two coupled systems (as often the case for vibration isolation) then this technique does not capture the absolute velocity. (\Eg, with reference to \figref{simple-isolation}, the signal $\gp{\velMass-\velBase}$ is being estimated, not $\velMass$.)

Recently, \textcite{williams2009} showed a filter system designed to estimate absolute velocity from accelerometer measurements in order to implement skyhook damping.
With the addition of a small higher frequency resonance, their filter was able to add damping to and shift the resonance peak into the lower frequencies; unfortunately, this research was published after experimental measurements for this thesis had completed and their ideas were not able to be tested in the apparatus discussed in this section.


\subsection{Translational effects of the rotating beam}
\seclabel{rotating-beam}

Three moving magnets were required in the system: one at the main end of the
motional beam to be repelled for positive stiffness by the fixed lower magnet;
a second to be used with electromagnetic coil for control forces; and the
third to be attracted for negative stiffness by the fixed upper magnet.

The beam added a horizontal constraint to the system for stability. As the
beam rotates, the magnets move predominantly in the vertical direction; there
is still some horizontal motion, however, and the area restricted by the
electromagnetic coil requires attention to ensure that there is no contact
between the moving magnet and the fixed coil. However, the smaller the inner
radius of the coil, the greater the forces imparted by the coil on the magnet
(see \figref[vref]{vary-airgap}), so the smaller the tolerance the better.

A simplified geometry of the moving magnet arrangement is used to calculate
the minimum tolerance required to avoid contact with the coil as a function
of the vertical motion of the magnets. This geometry is shown in
\figref{horiz-tolerance}, where the L-shaped magnet support is shown
in the `rest' position $\overline{OAB}$ and in a rotated position $\overline{OA'B'}$.

\begin{figure}
  \asyfig{Rig/horiz-tolerance}
  \caption{Geometry for calculating the horizontal tolerance of the inner
           dimensions of the coil.}
  \figlabel{horiz-tolerance}
\end{figure}

The horizontal displacement of the highest point after rotation, $x$, can be
calculated as a function of rotation angle $\theta$
\begin{dgroup}
\begin{dmath}
  x = h \Sin{\theta} + f
\end{dmath},
\begin{dmath}
  f = l - l \Cos{\theta}
\end{dmath},
\end{dgroup}
where $l$ is the horizontal length of the magnet arrangement, and $h$ is the
vertical height. This can be expressed in terms of the vertical displacement
of the main beam, $z$, with $\Sin{\theta}=z/l$ and using the trigonometric
relationship $\Cos{\ArcSin{a}}=\sqrt{1-a^2}$:
\begin{dmath}
  x = h z / l + l - \sqrt{l^2-z^2}
\end{dmath}.

From the dimensions chosen for the rig, $l=\SI{300}{mm}$ and
$h\approx\SI{50}{mm}$, the minimum horizontal tolerance for a vertical
displacement $z=\SI{1}{mm}$ is \SI{0.168}{mm} and for $z=\SI{2}{mm}$ is
\SI{0.34}{mm}. (The relationship between $x$ and $z$ being fairly linear for
most values of $l$ and $h$ with small ranges of $z$.) This tolerance was
judged to be small enough to allow a surrounding coil without having a
significantly diminished force characteristic from the air gap required to
avoid contact.

\section{Experimental results}

A number of measurements were performed using the experimental apparatus;
in the sections following, data recorded is presented for
\begin{enumerate}
\item Magnet gap versus beam displacement;
\item Open loop frequency responses for a range of magnet gaps; and,
\item Velocity feedback in a single configuration.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Displacement calibration}

The upper magnet's position was varied until the limit of stability was
reached. The lower fixed magnet was kept fixed, which means that the position
of \qzs/ was changing; with counter-threaded mounts for the upper and lower
magnets, they could be adjusted in parallel to achieve a fixed \qzs/ location.

As the upper magnet placement was lowered, the rest position of the beam moved
closer to the \qzs/ position (as more force was supported by the upper magnet).
This relationship is shown in \figref{turns-qzs}.
The normalised magnet gap is used in the following sections to
represent the varied configuration of the spring in the experiments.
From the geometry of the rig,
the position of the upper magnet was used to calculate the
gap between the magnets at \qzs/:
\begin{dmath}
  \OriginMagGap =
    \half\gp{\HeightRig-\OriginMagLow-\OriginMagHigh-\HeightRigMagnets}
    +\HeightMag+\HeightBuffer
\end{dmath},
where geometrical properties are described in \tabref{rigprop} and
$\HeightBuffer=\SI{2.5}{mm}$ is a little extra height to account for extra
space taken up by the beam shell thickness and the shell of the magnet mount.
The normalised magnet gap is $\ngap=\OriginMagGap/\HeightMag$, where
$\HeightMag$ is the height of the magnets.

\begin{figure}
  \psfragfig{\phdpath XPMT/latex/turns-qzs}
  \caption{Rest position of the system as the magnet position varies.}
  \figlabel{turns-qzs}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Open loop measurements}

As the position of the upper magnet is varied, the amount of negative
stiffness added to the system changes. This predominantly affects the rest
position and the resonance frequency, along with small changes in
damping. Frequency response measurements were taken at a number of discrete
locations of the upper fixed magnet to observe the changes in dynamics as the
rest position of the system approached the \qzs/ position.

The parameters used to perform the spectral analysis for each measurement are
shown in \tabref{rig-ol-spect}. Due to the low damping and low resonance
frequency of the system, very long sample times were required to achieve
results with enough frequency resolution and sufficient coherence to
characterise the response. A high sample rate (\SI{1000}{Hz}) was chosen to
reduce the possibility of controller time delays influencing the feedback
control, as discussed in \secref{vibes-feedback}.

\begin{table}
  \begin{tabular}{@{}ll@{}}
    \toprule
      Sample rate        & \SI{1000}{Hz}           \\
      \FFT\ points       & $2^{16}$                \\
      Sample time        & $\approx$\SI{17.5}{min} \\
      Average overlap    & $0.75$                  \\
      Number of non-overlapping averages & $16$    \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Parameters used in the signal and spectrum analysis for the
   experimental measurements.}
  \tablabel{rig-ol-spect}
\end{table}

Open loop measurements were taken both with and without the electromagnetic
actuator connected (wired up as both a short circuit and an open circuit). In
the closed circuit configuration, the coil adds damping via induced eddy
currents from the moving magnet. As an open circuit, the coil has no effect on
the dynamics of the system.

Open loop measurements without the coil connected are shown in
\figref{ol-undamped-frflin}. and measurements taken with the coil (\ie, with
added damping) are shown in \figref{ol-damped-frflin}. For both of these results,
the transmissibility, $\transmissibility$, shown is the transfer function
between the accelerometer measurements of the base and magnet-supported beam:

\begin{dmath}[label=Tbm]

           comparison to \figref{ol-undamped-frflin}.}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Analysis of the open loop data}

From the measurements shown in the previous section, data fitting of the frequency response functions was used to extract a linear model of the system in each configuration.
While more sophisticated techniques are possible \cite{chen2009}, fitting the data to a known exact frequency response function yielded acceptable results in this case since the peaks are quite simple.

% doublecheck how I want to say this
The model used to fit the data was a simple vibration isolation system
given by \eqref{simple-isolation-freq} in terms of the natural frequency, $\natfreq =
\sqrt{\stiffness/\mass}$, and damping ratio $\dampingratio = \damping /
(2\sqrt{\stiffness\mass})$. The resulting expression is
\begin{dmath}[label=fit-model]
  \transmissibility = \frac
    {2\ii\dampingratio\freq\natfreq + \natfreq^2}
    {-\freq^2 + 2\ii\dampingratio\freq\natfreq + \natfreq^2},
\end{dmath}
where $\freq$ is the frequency at which to calculate the transmissibility
$\transmissibility$. The data was fit
    \note{Using \Matlab/'s \code{fminsearch}.}% check
to \eqref{fit-model} between $\half\natfreq \le \freq
\le 2\natfreq$, returning good estimates of the natural frequency and
damping ratio of the system corresponding to each measurement taken. Plots of
the curve fit models shown against the measured data are shown in
\figref{ol-undamped-frflin-fit,ol-damped-frflin-fit}. Due to the influence of
higher-order dynamics in the system, the model starts to deviate from the data
at higher frequencies. The natural frequencies and damping ratios are shown
in \figref{ol-results}.

\end{figure}

From \figref{ol-reson} it can be seen that the natural frequency remains
unaffected by the presence of the electromagnetic coil (which can also be
observed by comparing \figref{ol-undamped-frflin,ol-damped-frflin}) but the
damping is increased significantly.


\subsection{Observed nonlinear behaviour}

The dynamics shown in the undamped case are more nonlinear than the damped
case; this is due to the greater displacements experienced by the beam moving
the magnets through greater ranges of stiffness variation. When the
transmissibility is calculated as the transfer function between the input and
output signals, the system is assumed to be linear and nonlinearities are
rejected by the ratio of the cross-spectrum and power-spectrum terms in
\eqref{Tbm}. A different result can be shown by calculating the
transmissibility instead with a ratio of the individual power spectra of the
base and magnet:
\begin{dmath}[label=frfnl]
  \transmissibility = \sqrt{\powerSpectMagnet/\powerSpectBase},
\end{dmath}
where $\powerSpectMagnet$ is the power spectra of the accelerometer
measurements at the moving magnet and $\powerSpectMagnet$ is the power spectra
of the accelerometer measurements of the base. In this case, any
nonlinearities in the signals are retained in the final result.

The transmissibility calculated with this method is shown in
\figref{ol-undamped-frfnl}. In this case, the nonlinearities present in the
system are more prominent, and a clear peak is shown at close to twice the
`natural' resonance frequency.

  \figlabel{ol-undamped-frfnl}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Velocity feedback results}

For this experiment, the rest position of the spring was chosen to some low
resonant frequency (approximately \SI{3.5}{Hz}) and velocity feedback was applied
to the system. Sampling parameters were as shown previously in
\tabref{rig-ol-spect}.

In this position, the electromagnetic coil was used in a simple velocity
feedback controller in an attempt to reduce the height of the resonance peak.
The gain of the feedback control was increased until the system became close
to instability. Frequency response measurements over this range of feedback
gains are shown in \figref{cl-results}.

\begin{figure}
  \psfragfig{\phdpath XPMT/latex/cl-results}
  \caption{Closed loop frequency response measurements for a range of velocity feedback gains.}
  \figlabel{cl-results}
\end{figure}

To estimate the velocity of the moving beam, the accelerometer measurement is
integrated by the charge amplifier with a cut-on frequency of \SI{1}{Hz}.
Because the accelerometers were now being used to measure velocity, the
transmissibility curves shown in \figref{cl-results} were calculated from the
ratio of the velocity measurements.

Due to the presence of higher-order dynamics in the structure, a low pass
filter was used to reject signals above \SI{50}{Hz}. This also ensured that
aliasing was avoided when taking the frequency response measurements and when
feeding back the velocity signal for the controller.

The overall improvement to the vibration isolation can be shown by calculating
the root-mean-square of the transmissibility over a certain frequency range.
\begin{dmath}
  \RMSof\transmissibility =
  \sqrt{\Sum{\transmissibility^2}{\freq,\freq_1,\freq_2}}
\end{dmath}
The lower frequency limit is defined as $\freq_1=\SI{1}{Hz}$, as the results
become very noisy below this frequency. The upper frequency limit
$\freq_2=\SI{11}{Hz}$ was chosen as the higher-order dynamics (not shown in
\figref{cl-results}) have little impact yet at this frequency.

\Figref{cl-reduction} shows the reduction in root-mean-square transmissibility
$\RMSof\transmissibility$ the negative feedback gain increases.
The resonance appearing in the lower frequencies of \figref{cl-results} causes
the overall transmissibility reduction to have a local minimum.

\begin{figure}
  \psfragfig{\phdpath XPMT/latex/cl-reduction}
  \caption{Reduction in overall transmissiblity between \SI{1}{Hz} and \SI{11}{Hz}.}
  \figlabel{cl-reduction}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{On the feedback gain magnitude} \Figref{cl-results,cl-reduction}
plot results in terms of a `feedback gain' given in dimensionless units. This
gain is the multiplier from the controller on the velocity signal that also
incorporates the effects of the amplifiers for both sensors and actuators;
therefore, the absolute magnitude of this number is unimportant and is used
purely to demonstrate the range of behaviours seen as the gain is increased
until instability appears.

\subsubsection{Analysis on the gain-induced resonance}

The appearance of a low frequency peak in \figref{cl-results} as the feedback
gain is increased is explained by the presence of the high-pass filter
incorporated in the accelerometer charge amplifier. This behaviour is shown by
\textcite{ananthaganeshan2001,brennan2007} for single \dof/
structures with velocity feedback. Here, the same type of analysis will be
used to investigate the response of a linear two \dof/ isolator
system (shown in \figref{vibration-base-feedback}) with integrated
accelerometer measurements used for velocity feedback control.

\begin{figure}
  \asyfig{Systems/vibration-base-feedback}
  \caption{Vibration isolation schematic with active feedback.}
  \figlabel{vibration-base-feedback}
\end{figure}

In the time domain, the response of this linear system is given by
\begin{dmath}
\massMass \accMass =
  \forceIn - \damping\gp{\velMass-\velBase} - \stiffness\gp{\dispMass-\dispBase}
\end{dmath},
which can be re-written in the Laplace domain as
\begin{dmath}[label=simple-isolator-laplace]
s^2 \laplaceMass \underbrace{\gp{\massMass+\damping/s+\stiffness/s^2}}_{\gp{\Block[2]}^{-1}} =
  \laplaceForce + s^2 \laplaceBase \underbrace{\gp{\damping/s+\stiffness/s^2}}_{\Block[1]}
\end{dmath}.
This is shown as a block diagram in \figref{simple-isolator-block}. If the
control force is written as a function of the acceleration of the mass,
$\laplaceForce=s^2\laplaceMass\BlockController$, the transmissibility of the system is
\begin{dmath}[label=cl-generic]
  \frac\laplaceMass\laplaceBase = \frac{\Block[1]\Block[2]}{1+\BlockController\Block[2]}
\end{dmath}.

\begin{figure}
  \asyfig{Control/simple-isolator-block}
  \caption{Block diagram of \eqref{simple-isolator-laplace} representing
  the system shown in \figref{vibration-base-feedback}.}
  \figlabel{simple-isolator-block}
\end{figure}

When the controller is some gain $\gain$ in series with an ideal integration of the accelerometer signal, $\BlockController = \gain/s$, \eqref{cl-generic} simplifies to the idealised absolute velocity feedback expression introduced in \secref[vref]{skyhook}:
\begin{dmath}
\frac{\gainDisp+\stiffness+s \gp{\damping+\gainVel+\gainAcc s}}{\gainDisp+\gainSkyspring+\stiffness+s \gp{\damping+\gainSkyhook+\gainVel+\gp{\gainAcc+\gainSkymass+\mass} s}}
\end{dmath}
This result is plotted in \figref{cl-ideal} for equivalent values of stiffness and damping as the experimental setup.

A more complex model for the controller block is required to account for the
signal processing involved with amplifying and filtering the accelerometer
signal to measure the velocity in reality. Assuming that the entire process
between acceleration measurement and velocity output from the charge amplifier
can be approximated as an ideal integrator in series with two high pass
filters\footnote{One filter for the integration of the acceleration signal,
another for the conditioning electronics in the amplifier; assume for
simplicity that they have the same cut-on frequency.} \parencite{brennan2007},
the controller block is defined as
\begin{dmath}[label=cl-filter-controller]
  \BlockController = \frac \gain s \gp{\frac{s}{s+\freqHPfilter}}^2
\end{dmath},
where $\gain$ is the feedback gain and $\freqHPfilter$ is the corner frequency
of the high pass filter in the charge amplifier.

Using \eqref{cl-filter-controller} in \eqref{cl-generic} gives
the final transfer function between the mass and base states,
\begin{dmath}[label=cl-filter]
  \frac\laplaceMass\laplaceBase =
    \frac{ \gp{\damping s+\stiffness} \gp{s+\freqHPfilter}^2 }
         {
           \gain s^3 +
           \gp{ \massMass s^2 + \damping s + \stiffness }
           \gp{ s+\freqHPfilter }^2
         }
\end{dmath}.
This is plotted versus frequency in \figref{cl-filter}, where the resonance
induced by the high pass filter becomes apparent as the feedback gain is
increased to 99\% of the maximum gain (which is the gain when the system
becomes unstable). The simulation uses linear parameters $\freq=\SI{3.5}{Hz}$
and $\dampingratio=\num{0.023}$ in order to show results at similar behaviour to \figref{cl-results}.

In order to calculate the maximum gain of \eqref{cl-filter},
$\BlockController\Block[2]$ was evaluated equal to $-1$, where the system
response of \eqref{cl-generic} becomes unbounded. To do this, first the
critical frequency was found as the frequency at which
$\Imag{\BlockController\Block[2]}=0$; this frequency was then substituted into
$\Real{\BlockController\Block[2]}=-1$, which was solved for $\gain$ to find
the maximum gain.

  \end{wide}
  \caption{Closed loop simulation with gains $\{0, 5, 10, 20, 50, 99\}$ percent of the maximum gain before instability in \figref{cl-filter}.}
\end{figure}

Comparing \figref{cl-filter} with \figref{cl-results} shows a clear
similarity. The corner frequency of the high pass filter at \SI{1}{Hz} in the
charge amplifier to measure velocity is an impediment to the vibration
isolation properties of the feedback-controlled system. This potential
drawback could be mitigated with a different way to estimate the velocity of
the isolated beam; simply a higher-precision charge amplifier would probably
be acceptable.
