\section{Acknowledgements}

I would not be where I am today without countless hours of wrong turns and
blind charges.
I have some people to thank for their criticisms at one time or another.
Richard Kelso (2004): "[This] leaves me wondering whether you are just juggling magnets." (Turns out that, yes, I was.)
Paraphrasing Nobua Tanaka (2005): "A spring made with magnets is still a spring!"
Will Robertson (2007): "What have I been doing for the last four years?"
(Inspiration and perspiration was bound to strike eventually.)

My first thanks go to my busy supervisors Ben and Anthony, who gave me the freedom to be myself.
With stricter guidance I may have finished sooner, but I don't believe I would have been better for it.

My second thanks are for the people I've met and spent time with over the years in association with my studies.
Justin Ghan got me into this whole mess to begin with, and from even the other side of the world I feel like I've strange loops of him in my head.
Rohin Wood and Dick Petersen were great friends and influences in the years we spent together in the office; Zebb Prime has been the best of co-conspirators. Mike Kidner and I had some great talks and shared many interests.
Guillaume Barrault was my brother in arms in the time he spent in Adelaide, from the very first week.
Hannah Weisbecker reminded me of my passion for engineering and expanded my culinary world.

My third thanks are for those who I've work with on projects unrelated to my thesis.
The world is large, but seems much less so when people who've never met collaborate from across the globe on shared passions and distractions.

My final thanks go to all the friends and family who have loved, supported,
and made me happy in this amazing period of my life.
Most of all, for she who's shared my life for the same time as this project has, Toni: you are my complement and our adventures next will be like nothing that's come before.
