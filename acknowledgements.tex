\section*{Acknowledgements}

\itshape
Thanks to my supervisors Ben and Anthony, who gave me the freedom to be myself and who inspired me beyond my work.
My appreciation couldn't be greater for the long leash they allowed me.
With stricter guidance I may have finished sooner, but I believe neither I nor this thesis would have been the better for it.

This thesis is dedicated to all those with whom I've shared this life over many years, especially to those who have come into the world and to those who have departed it during this period of my life.
