\section*{Acknowledgements \& Dedication}

\begin{quote}
\itshape
Thanks to my supervisors Ben and Anthony, who gave me the freedom to be myself and who inspired me beyond my work.
My appreciation couldn't be greater for the long leash they allowed me.
With stricter guidance I may have finished sooner, but I believe neither I nor this thesis would have been the better for it.

\medskip
\noindent
This thesis is dedicated to those many with whom I've shared this happy life, especially to those in this time who have come into this strange world and to those who have departed from it.
