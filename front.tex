\section*{Colophon}

{\centering\begin{minipage}{0.89\textwidth}
\parfillskip=0pt
This document has been prepared and typeset using \LaTeX{}.
The width of the text block is 369\,pt, and the text is set with the font Palatino at size 11\,pt and leading 13.6\,pt.
Microtypographical features, including margin kerning, have been used to ensure better typesetting.
\PPP
Page margins have been chosen as a trade-off between trying to achieve an optimal number of characters per line for ease of reading~\makebox[\widthof{[50]}]{\cite{bringhurst-typestyle}} and fitting the typeblock well onto \acro{A4} stock.
Due to the large space available in the margins, many figures are typeset intentionally to protrude into them.
\PPP
If you are reading this electronically, \PDF\ hyperlinks have been automatically inserted in all appropriate cross-referencing positions, including the nomenclature and bibliography.\par
