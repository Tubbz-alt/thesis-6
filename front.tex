This document has been prepared and typeset using \LaTeX{}.
\PPP
Page margins have been chosen as a trade-off between achieving the optimal number of characters per line for ease of reading, and fitting the typeblock well onto \acro{A4} stock \cite{bringhurst-typestyle}.
Due to the large space available in the margins, many figures are typeset intentionally to protrude into them.
\PPP
If you are reading this electronically, \PDF\ hyperlinks have been automatically inserted in all appropriate cross-referencing positions, including the nomenclature and bibliography.
