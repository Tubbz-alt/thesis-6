\section{Introduction to the central themes of the thesis}

Before launching into detail into the various topics under investigation, this
section briefly touches on the issues addressed over the entire thesis:
vibrations and their isolation and suppression in
\secref{vibrations-summary-intro}; permanent magnets and their role in the
design of supporting structures and other devices in
\secref{magnets-summary-intro}; and `\qzs' systems, which unify in this thesis
the fields of vibrations and magnets, in \secref{qzs-summary-intro}. These
three broad areas are then investigated in more detail in \secrangeref{vibrations-explore}{qzs-explore}.

\subsection{The problem of vibrations}
\seclabel{vibrations-summary-intro}

The disturbing effects of vibrations are a well-known and continuing problem.
The transmission of vibrations from a source can only ever be reduced, not eliminated — that is, not without removing the source entirely from the local region affected. And in many cases there is no single source; the very ground itself may be a medium through which undesirable vibrations are transmitted.
Earthquakes are an extreme example of this, but on a smaller scale there are continuous time-varying displacements of the `fixed' ground beneath us.
\note{Not to be too earth-centric, but many of the ideas here have a different relevance in off-planet circumstances.}
The earth should in fact be considered as a distributed vibrating structure, of very great mass in total, that has a range of displacement profiles dependent on the local surrounding impedance conditions. 

Whether the source of the disturbance is near or far, or how it propagates
through the ground to arrive at the region of interest, these disturbances can
cause a variety in problems on equipment that is required to, ideally, remain
absolutely still. A good example is during the electro-lithography performed
to construct our microchips, in which nanometre-sized disturbances can affect
the overall yield of the silicon wafer produced. Mitigating the effects of a
disturbance through the base on which a structure is supported is known as
`vibration isolation' and is the over-arching problem in which the work of
this thesis should be put in context.

A contrasting vibration problem occurs when some manner of machine causes its own vibration; a well-known example is a washing machine that exerts an oscillating disturbance force on itself through a mass imbalance. This type of vibration problem requires a rather different set of design solutions and often its solution acts in opposition to the vibration isolation problem discussed above. Reducing the effects of self-induced vibration disturbance will be termed `vibration suppression'
\note{The descriptor `Vibration isolation' is commonly used to refer to both problems, but it would be confusing here to avoid the clarification.}
for the purposes of this thesis and will be revisited on occassion herein.

There are a variety of `classic' solutions for both vibration isolation and
vibration suppression. A particularly simple solution for \emph{both} problems is to mount the equipment on a many-ton slab of concrete. This is not always practical. Another common approach for vibration isolation is to support the equipment with pneumatic springs. When in operation, these springs provide a low supporting stiffness and low static deflection; they can typically be used to support hundreds of kilograms with resonance frequency of less than five hertz.

Other support methods besides pneumatics are able to achieve low stiffness; this is an area that will be further investigated in the literature review. But one method in particular is interesting in this context: permanent magnets can provide low stiffness support without energy expenditure. Their nonlinear forces in both attraction and repulsion allows the possibility of interesting supporting designs, and their non-contact nature allows their use in vacuum and `clean-room' environments.

\subsection{Permanent magnets used for mechanical design}
\seclabel{magnets-summary-intro}

The last twenty years has seen the maturation of the rare earth permanent magnet industry. These magnets are now widely available in large sizes and strong magnetisation at relatively low prices. They are now used in a variety of mechanical design, including bearings, couplings, \maglev\ trains, and so on, which take advantage of non-contact attractive and/or repulsive forces.
Magnets can be used to make other magnets move or to keep them in place — there is little limit to the ingenuity of their application. However, in part to this complex behaviour between them, there are few design guidelines that can be used to aid their use [quote Moskowitz].

We can speak broadly about their integrated use in force design: magnets can be used in conjunction with current-carrying coils to effect time-varying forces (as in shakers and speakers); soft iron can be used to guide the magnetic fields into desired regions or away from unwanted areas (\eg, latches and motors); or magnets can be used alone for unique force--displacement characteristics or simply for applying non-contact forces (\eg, bearings).

These ideas in mechanics and dynamics have application back to the field of vibrations. A `synergy' between the two fields is seen in areas such as energy harvesting from ambient vibration, the study of vibration in high-speed magnetic bearings, and one of the main themes of this thesis — nonlinear and/or noncontact forces for support equipment for vibration isolation.

Support mass with a noncontact force can also be called `levitation', an area which deserves its own mention. \textcite{earnshaw1842} proved that levitation with the force of permanent magnets alone was impossible, although this did not become common knowledge
\note{If it can even be said to be `commonly known' today. Anecdotal evidence suggests otherwise.}
until much later — given by the range of patents issued that assume the opposite. Exceptions to `Earshaw's Theorem' include the use of diamagnetic materials and actively-controlled system, amongst some others. It is the possibility of overcoming instability with active means that is of interest in this thesis.

\subsection{\QZS\ systems}
\seclabel{qzs-summary-intro}

The transition between stable and unstable forces becomes interesting in the context of vibration isolation. Between positive and negative stiffness in a force--displacement characteristic, there is a inflexion point of zero stiffness. This point is termed a `\qzs' position to emphasise that the dynamic behaviour of the system in this condition can be rather complex and usually unstable. `True' zero stiffness would imply \emph{no} connection between between the mass and the base, as if they were floating in free space — the motion of one would have no effect on the motion of the other.

As systems approach \qzs, their vibration isolation inproves as the resonant frequency decreases. Operation at the \qzs\ position is not possible as the system is, at best, only marginally stable, and the system must be tuned (based on the applied loading) to achieve best results.

Certain magnetic systems are not the only ones to exhibit \qzs. The phenomenon was first proposed using inclined springs to achieve a `buckling' effect. Magnets are more convenient in many ways than inclined or buckling springs in that the negative stiffness can be applied directly without having to exploit the byproduct of a mechanical spring or linkage arrangement, which can be more bulky.

Active control systems can be used with \qzs\ systems to improve their performance in one of three ways:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Standard active vibration control with velocity feedback;
  \item Remove the instability at the \qzs\ location with a nonlinear controller;
  \item Online tuning of the system for load-independent operation.
\end{enumerate}
The first two of these strategies are investigated in this thesis.

\subsection{Project context}

The original goal of this project was to design and build a vibration
isolation table using non-contact magnetic springs. This goal can be
split into two: the design of a non-contact magnetic spring (suitable
for a vibration isolation table); and the design of the vibration
isolation table itself.

Vibration isolation tables are generally designed to attenuate natural
disturbances from the ground to the tabletop. Current commercial models use
pneumatic springs to perform this task, and this project arose out of
curiosity: could magnetic springs be used instead?

Using magnets for load bearing brings its own set of challenges. For
completely non-contact support, active control must be used to
stabilise \emph{at least} one degree of freedom. For the design to be
worth investigating, some advantage to using magnets should also be
demonstrated.\footnote{Although I took much pleasure in explaining
  over the years that my \PhD\ project was to `build a table that
  floats on magnets'.}

However, the field of active control has been well-established and the feat of
building a stabilising controller for a system with relatively simple dynamics
is not worthy of the research for a \PhD. The work presented in this thesis is
the investigations around the idea of building a `table that floats on
magnets' while pulling out enough interesting nuggets to prove worthy of the
title of `research'.

\section{Vibrations}
\seclabel{vibrations-explore}

The field of active vibration isolation is a broad topic to cover in review;
not everything will be able to be covered here, but it is important to have an
overview of what people are doing to place this work in context. The
literature review that follows is strongly biased towards papers that have
been recently published. Tracking their citations backwards will yield a
tangled web of prior art in the field of vibration control.

\subsection{From QZS paper; to be fleshed out for the real intro}

Absolute velocity feedback control creates `skyhook' damping, in which
the resonance peak is reduced without affecting the vibration
transmission at higher frequencies~\cite{yan2006}. For an ideal single
degree of freedom system, this technique is limited by instability
caused by time delays in the
controller~\cite{elliott2004,brennan2007}.

Semi-active methods have also been developed to approximate this
technique when fully active control is
undesirable~\cite{liu2002,liu2005,ahmadian2004}. Semi-active control
has the advantages of robustness and low power requirements,
especially when large forces would be required for active control.

Reducing the stiffness of the support decreases the resonance
frequency of the system, which increases the bandwidth of vibration
isolation. This will improve the vibration isolation of the system
over the application of sky-hook damping, especially at low
frequencies.  For a given mass, this can be achieved by reducing the
stiffness of the support, or by adding a negative stiffness element in
parallel with the system~\cite{lee2007,xing2005}. Again, this can be
implemented by passive, active or semi-active methods. Negative
displacement or positive acceleration feedback can be used in a fully
active system. In the semi-active case, many methods exist to
dynamically adjust the stiffness depending on the support being used;
an example has been demonstrated by \textcite{kidner2002}.

In a conventional mass--spring system, the static deflection increases
as the stiffness of the support is reduced, and a lower limit on the
stiffness is imposed by constraints on the allowable
displacement. Less typical supports can exhibit stiffness that varies
nonlinearly with displacement; even local regions of zero stiffness
are possible. An example of a system with such behaviour is a parallel
connection of vertical and inclined
springs~\cite{molyneux1957,alabuzhev1989,carrella2006,carrella2007},
which has an approximately cubic force vs.\ displacement
characteristic; localised zero stiffness occurs at zero deflection,
which is termed `\qzs'. The use of buckling beams as a negative
stiffness element to achieve \qzs\ has also been implemented in
practice~\cite{platus1999,tarnai2003}. An example pertinent to this
research is the recent analysis by Carrella \emph{et al.} of a \qzs\
system using (positive stiffness) linear springs in parallel with negative
stiffness magnetic springs~\cite{carrella2008}. Further detail into the
field  of nonlinear passive vibration isolators is given in the recent
review by \textcite{ibrahim2008}.


\subsection{Linear systems}

\Figref{simple-isolation} shows the simplest form of vibration
isolation in which a mass $\massMass$ is mounted with stiffness
$\stiffnessRel$ with disturbance input $\dispBase$. Passive
isolation is achieved for zero input force, $\forceIn=0$. Feedback
control allows the properties of the system to be adjusted
according the desired vibration response.

\begin{figure}
  \asyfig{Systems/vibration-base}
  \caption{Single degree of freedom vibration isolation mount;
    mass $\massMass$ is being isolated from disturbance
    $\dispBase$. Input force $\forceIn$ can be generated using
    feedforward or feedback control.}
  \figlabel{simple-isolation}
\end{figure}

The dynamic response of the isolated mass is
\begin{dmath}[label=simple-isolation]
  \massMass\ddot\dispMass +
  \dampingRel\gp{\dot\dispMass-\dot\dispBase} +
  \stiffnessRel\gp{\dispMass-\dispBase} + \forceIn = 0 .
\end{dmath}
First assume that there is no input force; taking the Laplace
tranform and rearranging produced the transmissibility
$\transmissibility$ of the system in the frequency domain:
\begin{dmath}[compact,label=simple-isolation-freq]
  \transmissibility\fn\freq = \frac{\laplaceMass}{\laplaceBase} = 
  \frac{\ii\freq\dampingRel + \stiffnessRel}
  {-\massMass\freq^2 + \ii\freq\dampingRel + \stiffnessRel}.
\end{dmath}

For ideal linear state feedback control, the input force can be
represented as a linear combination of measured relative
displacement $\gp{\dispMass-\dispBase}$, relative velocity
$\gp{\dot\dispMass-\dot\dispBase}$, and acceleration
$\ddot\dispMass$ of the mass. Let's also assume for now that
integrating the acceleration signal yields an exact absolute
velocity $\dot\dispMass$ of the mass as well. The generalised
feedback force can then be represented by
\begin{dmath}
 \forceIn = 
   \gainDisp\gp{\dispMass-\dispBase} + 
   \gainVel \gp{\dot\dispMass-\dot\dispBase} +
   \gainAcc \ddot\dispMass + 
   \gainSky \dot\dispMass
\end{dmath},
where $\gainArbitrary$ are feedback gains chosen appropriately for a given application.
The term involving $\gainSky$ is known as skyhook damping. Substituting this force equation
into \eqref{simple-isolation} yields
\begin{dmath}
  \gp{\massMass+\gainAcc}\ddot\dispMass +
  \gp{\dampingRel+\gainVel}\gp{\dot\dispMass-\dot\dispBase} +
  \gp{\stiffnessRel+\gainDisp}\gp{\dispMass-\dispBase} +
  \gainSky\dot\dispMass 
  = 0
\end{dmath}.

It can be clearly seen that there is an exact equivalence between the feedback
gains of the different signals and a corresponding physical parameter of the
system. For example, adding gain on the displacement feedback is analogous to
increasing the stiffness of the system. The one standout here is the `skyhook'
damping term, whose influence can be better seen in the equation for
transmissibility of the closed loop system. For this example, let displacement
and acceleration gains equal zero, $\gainDisp=\gainAcc=0$, resulting in
\begin{dmath}[compact,label=skyhook]
  \transmissibility\fn\freq = \frac{\laplaceMass}{\laplaceBase} = 
  \frac{\ii\freq\gp{\dampingRel+\gainVel} + \stiffnessRel}
    {-\massMass\freq^2 + \ii\freq\gp{\dampingRel+\gainVel+\gainSky} + \stiffnessRel}.
\end{dmath}
The transmissibilities due to the influence of relative velocity gain and
absolute velocity gain are shown in \figref{vel-vs-sky} with parameters
$\massMass=\SI{1}{kg}$, $\dampingRel=\SI{1}{kg/s}$,
$\stiffnessRel=\SI{10}{N/m}$, and the respective gains $\gainVel$ and
$\gainSky$ ranging from $0$ to $5$ corresponding from light to dark plot
lines.

\begin{figure}
   \begin{wide}
     \psfragfig{\phdpath Simulations/Springs/fig/sdof-vel}\hfil
     \psfragfig{\phdpath Simulations/Springs/fig/sdof-sky}

   \caption{Relative and absolute (`skyhook') velocity feedback control on the 
   system shown in \figref{simple-isolation}. Feedback gain increases as the 
   plot line ranges from light to dark.}
   \figlabel{vel-vs-sky}
\end{figure}

In comparing the \RMS\ transmissibilities over the frequency range of interest
($\sqrt{\Int{\transmissibility\fn\freq}{\freq,\freq_1,\freq_2}}$) as a function of
increasing feedback gain for the two cases, it is clear in the ideal case that
skyhook damping is more efficacious at reducing the total vibration of a
system. This is shown in \figref{rms-transmissibility}, where the relative
feedback \RMS\ transmissiblity has a local minimum whereas the skyhook case
continuously decreases. (The maximum frequency in this case was chosen to be
much greater than the resonance frequency;
$[\freq_1,\freq_2]=[0,\SI{1000}{rad/s}]$.)

\begin{figure}
   \psfragfig{\phdpath Simulations/Springs/fig/rms-transmissibility}
   \caption{\RMS\ transmissibility versus feedback gain of relative and 
   absolute (`skyhook') velocity feedback control on the system shown in 
   \figref{simple-isolation}.}
   \figlabel{rms-transmissibility}
\end{figure}

Velocity feedback control by using integrated accelerometer measurements at
the location of actuation has been used for some time as an effective
vibration isolation mechanism, shown for example by \textcite{kim1999} at the
ISVR at the University of Southampton, an institution that has been very
active in this field.

The limits of control in real-world devices was investigated by
\textcite{ananthaganeshan2001}, where time delays and phase lags introduced by
digital filters and integrators can have quite significant effects over the
ideal case of pure displacement or velocity or acceleration feedback (as
posited in the previous section). Real integrators (as opposed to ideal
integrators) and high pass filters cause instabilities at low frequencies.
Acceleration feedback has much smaller stability limit than displacement and
velocity. And the effect of displacement feedback is strongly reduced even
with small time delays. Therefore velocity feedback control from integrated
accelerometer measurements should be consided the better choice. Also, the
presence of a low pass filter does not significantly effect the efficacy of
velocity feedback.

\textcite{zhu2006} look at using such feedback in a highly sensitive
micro-gravity environment and show that `PID' feedback is unsuitable due to
instability at high (\ie, useful) control gains from quantisation and
anti-aliasing side-effects. Rather, integral and double-integral feedback from
an accelerometer give better results for them.

\subsection{Sensing}

The sensors used for active vibration control systems can make a
significant impact on the performance that the control can
achieve. \textcite{brennan2007} discuss the impacts of using
displacement, velocity, and acceleration feedback for a single degree
of freedom system in the context of signal conditioning filters and
digital time delays in the loop. Integrating an accelerometer signal
may be a convenient method to approximate the velocity, but it limits
the control performance that can be achieved compared to measuring the
velocity directly with a laser sensor (say).

It is always desired to minimise the number of sensors due to cost and
implementation complexity, and various methods may be used to estimate
states of a system that are not directly measured. If displacement and
acceleration are measured, a reasonable estimate of the velocity may
be computed by differentiating and integrating, respectively, the
measured signals and combining the results.

This method has been practised by \textcite{bennett2007}, and it works
acceptably well because the low frequency components can be obtained
from the derivative of the displacement and the high frequency
components can be obtained by integration of the acceleration. The
only question is where to draw the line in the frequency domain
between the two signals.

I've lost my paper that does this much more cleverly. Actually I haven't looked.


\subsection{Skyhook damping}
\seclabel{skyhook}

An attractive method of reducing the effects of resonance peaks is to add
damping to the structure. If this is performed by an actuator attached to the
`sky' instead of the ground, the advantage of knocking out the resonance peak
is not counteracted by an increase in higher frequency vibration (less
roll-off), which is the case for damping control with ground-fixed actuators.
This scheme is known as `skyhook' damping.

In the context of isolating vibration of a train, \textcite{li1999} discuss
the disadvantages in tracking when applying skyhook damping for systems that
experience very low frequency (\ie, steady state) changes in the base
position, but for the purposes of vibration isolation this is not a problem if
the ground is assumed to experience disturbance with zero mean. (They also use
Kalman filters for estimating velocity, an idea I'm keen on.)

A similar result \fixme{check/qualify this} can be achieved with dynamic stiffness control,
which can be effected with `semi-active' variable stiffness feedback control
\cite{leavitt2007}.

In the original and crude method of implementing skyhook control, the
switching mode that is necessary to emulate the `skyhook' in the controlled
damping introduces higher order (odd-multiple) harmonics in the frequency
response, as shown by \textcite{ahmadian2001}, who later proposed two
`jerk-free' skyhook algorithms \cite{ahmadian2004}.

Further work in the area was established by \textcite{liu2002}, who
demonstrated a number of skyhook-like semi-active damping methods, including
smoothing functions to eliminate the problem of jerk
\cite{liu2005}.\footnote{These references by Liu contain essentially the same
material, with greater detail in the first. The 2005 paper is easier to read
than the 2002 Technical Memorandum simply due to the formatting of the
documents.}

\textcite{song2007} used the nonlinearities of semi-active skyhook damping as
justification for the design of an adaptive controller for vibration
isolation; they did not compare their results with recent work in the skyhook
area, however.

Skyhook damping can also be implemented with fully active control systems, an
idea explored by, \eg, \textcite{elliott2001,elliott2004,yan2006,kim2008a}
\fixme{describe these more}. These methods are conceptually simpler, as the
inertial velocity can easily be obtained from integrated acceleration
measurements. Instability can occur in cases when the applied control force
affects the dynamics of the base, but in practice this tends not to be a
problem for comparatively massive support structures.

\textcite{serrand2000} discuss active skyhook damping applied to a two degree
of freedom structure with emphasis on the effects, for their system, due to
possible base flexibility. One of their results shows that using integrated
accelerometer measurements as a velocity feedback term has a low frequency
phase shift that can induce stability for high enough control gains.
Therefore, very high precision accelerometers or laser velocity vibrometers
are required for very low frequency vibration control (below \SI{1}{Hz}).




\subsection{Inertial actuators}

Sometimes it is not possible to integrate the control mechanism into the
support of a structure, in which case external actuators need to be added to
the device to provide the control forces. These tend to be inertial
electromagnetic actuators, also known as `proof-mass' actuators, where the
mass of the moving element provides an external force via coupling to the
structure. This is shown schematically in \figref{vibration-absorb}

\begin{figure}
   \asyfig{Systems/vibration-inertial} 
   \caption{An inertial force $\forceAbsorb$ designed to reduce the vibration 
   response $\dispMass$ due to disturbance $\dispBase$. The inertial actuator 
   has dynamics of its own ($\stiffnessAbsorb$, $\dampingAbsorb$) that 
   influence the overall vibration of the structure.}
   \figlabel{vibration-absorb}
\end{figure}

In this case, velocity feedback on its own can have problems with stability
margins at low frequencies. \textcite{benassi2002a} (using inertial actuators)
showed in experiment that this can be improved by the addition of a phase lag
controller with force feedback in conjuection with velocity feedback. The
theory for such `combined-state' feedback cases was subsequently developed
\cite{benassi2002b}.

A wide combination of feedback combinations was analysed by
\textcite{diaz2005} focussing on various forms of velocity feedback for
single-, double-, and multi-degree of freedom vibration isolation systems. In
the two degree of freedom system, an inertial actuator is used to provide
control force; as well as additional stability contraints due to this
arrangement, the resonance at low frequencies of the actuator itself
compromised the control performance.

(A possible solution to this problem might be to select an actuator with a
much \emph{greater} resonance frequency than the plant, but this arrangement
has been shown to be ineffective at controlling the system
\cite[][Appendix~A]{benassi2002}.)

A comparison of some of these methods, including skyhook damping and
semi-active vibration absorber methods, was done by \textcite{huyanan2007},
contrasting the performance and implementation differences between them.

\textcite{paulitsch2003} uses an electromechanical actuator that serves as a
self-sensing device for vibration control. The idea of self-sensing for
magnetic levitation purposes (in both cases using a electromagnet) has been
shown by \textcite{bleuler1992,vischer1993}. These self-sensing devices
(perhaps obviously, since the back--electromotive force is such a noisy
signal) do not perform nearly as well as when using a dedicated sensor, but
the technique is particularly interesting for low-cost, low-precision devices.





\subsection{Tuned vibration absorber}

One method of reducing vibration on a supported mass is to attach a
supplementary mass that resonanates in concert with the disturbance; this has
the effect of adding an anti-resonance to the original system at the frequency
of interest. These are known under various names as `tuned mass dampers',
`tuned vibration neutralisers', or `dynamic vibration absorbers' (presumably
other variations exist).

The concept of tuned mass dampers is not entirely the focus of this research,
but falls into the category of literature that crops up in association with
it. In the passive application, a tuned vibration absorber consists of
attaching a supplementary mass with a spring to the structure for which
vibration is to be removed. Excellent results can be achieved in knocking out
a resonance peak by matching the natural frequencies of the structure and the
additional mass. This is shown in \figref{tuned-mass-vs-fig} where a response
is shown for a range of stiffness values. There is a compromise between broad-
and narrow-band vibration attentuation. \Figref{inertial-trans-delta}
illustrates the vibration attenuation at resonance for a system with a
vibration absorber. It can be seen that for narrowband reduction, low absorber
damping produces greater vibration attenuation. Conversely, if the \RMS\
transmissiblity of the entire frequency band is calculated, as shown in
\figref{rms-inertial}, it can be seen that lower absorber damping
\emph{decreases} the overall vibration reduction.

\begin{figure}
   \psfragfig{\phdpath Simulations/Springs/fig/tuned-mass-vs-freq}
   \caption{Vibration absorber with a range of absorber frequencies. 
   When the absorber matches the resonance of the structure the vibration 
   amplitude around that frequency is greatly reduced.}

  \end{subfigure}
\end{wide}
\caption{A comparison of the effects of changing the damping ratio of the 
absorber on single-frequency and broadband transmissibility of a tuned mass 
damper.}
\end{figure}

\textcite{brennan2006} discusses a wide variety of actuators that may
be used to construct such a device:
\begin{quote}
  There is not a single ``best'' way of making an [adaptive tuned
  vibration absorber]. It depends upon the required frequency range,
  the agility (speed of reaction) and cost.
\end{quote}

The efficacy of the vibration absorber is related to the damping between it
and the structure; better results are achieved with lower damping, as shown in
\figref{rms-inertial}. The damping of the absorber can be reduced with an
active control system as shown by \textcite{kidner1998}. This can be
understood with the realisation that energy is not dissipated by the vibration
`absorber'; rather, motional energy from the vibration structure is
\emph{transferred} to the supplementary mass, and this process is degraded by
the presence of damping. This theme of the desirability of low damping
re-occurs at a later point in this thesis (crossref).

\textcite{felix2008} also recently demonstrated the use of coupling between a
cantilever under direct disturbance and a electromechanical damper with
nonlinear resistive and capacitive elements.

A paper I haven't read yet uses magnetorheological elastomer as a variable
stiffness element \cite{holdhusen2007}.

\textcite{casciati2007} uses a semi-active tuned mass damper to
control vibrations of a suspended cable; some care is required for
modal structures as their higher frequency (often nonlinear) behaviour
can pose an influence even as the targeted (low frequency) mode is
damped as desired.

Tuned vibration absorbers can also be effected artificially with a control
system \cite{kim2008a}.

Another application: \cite{moradi2008}

An extremely interesting novel device is demonstrated in the literature that
is a mechanically self-tuning vibration absorber \cite{ivers2008}. While not
as efficacious as a `true' vibration absorber, the ability to adapt to the
excitation frequency is very useful.

Tuned vibration absorbers are occasionally used to mitigate seismic vibrations
in large buildings, but their mass dependence makes their application rather
tricky and often impractical. \textcite{matta2008} propose a nonlinear
rolling structure via which a vibration absorber can be mounted to good effect
despite uncertain masses of either or both of the building and absorber. Their
work focuses on the novel idea of using a roof-top garden as a tuned mass
damper \parencite{matta2008a}.


\subsubsection{Fully active tuned vibration absorbers}

Some researchers have looked at using electromagnetic actuators to
provide an active force with which to cancel system resonances. The
advantage for such a system is the same as the semi-active case: with
a suitable controller, changes in the plant can be taken into account
in the vibration neutraliser. However, using a fully active system for
this task is not very energy efficient.

One example is the work by \textcite{chen2005a}, who use a linear
`voice coil motor' (crossref) as the actuator for a controller based
around a simple notch filter to remove the system resonance. Suffice
it to say that basic velocity feedback would have done a better job,
as the notch filter \emph{amplifies} vibration response in the
side-lobes of the filter.

While his work classically uses linear (\PID) control, a recent paper
by \textcite{wu2007} approaches this idea using an linear actuator
with a controller to simulate the dynamics of such a tuned absorber,
with additional dynamics to tune the resonances in the case of plant
changes. This is a good example of a poor choice of control strategy
by using empirical algorithms for a specific application rather than
applying a more general technique. \fixme{Don't be too harsh.}


\subsection{Internal resonances}

Idealised models assume system properties that are independent: a
spring has no mass, a damper has no stiffness, \etc. In practise,
however, such simplifications can be far from actual, and internal
resonances of actuators and passive absorbers can decrease the
performance of their intended vibration isolation
mechanisms. 

\textcite{du2003thesis} examined the effect of additional dynamics
from tuned vibration absorbers and the consequence that had on the
transmissibility and noise radiation of the structure under
control. While these additional high frequency dynamics would not be a
problem for certain problems (and the effects were worse in
viscoelastic-type springs; \ie, rubber springs over mechanical springs),
their effect must be considered for high-sensitivity vibration control
and cases where it is important to minimise radiated sound. In his
thesis he proposes methods to work around the internal resonance
problem using both passive and active means.

\textcite{wu2006} analysed the vibration response of a spring-mass-damper in
which the spring element had some inertial effect on the structure due to its
mass. The results presented show only a small magnification of the vibration
amplitude transmitted to the primary mass, particularly for small spring
relative masses; however, for highly sensitive equipment this phenomenom
should not be neglected.

Such internal resonance effects discussed above can be completely avoided by
using noncontact magnetic springs instead. On the other hand, the nonlinear
force/displacement relationship of magnetic springs will have some nonlinear
behaviour that could affect the vibration properties of such springs in other
ways. An example of this behaviour is demonstrated in
\secref[vref]{qzs-not-zerk}.





\section{Levitation}
\seclabel{levitation-explore}

Before looking at the general class of magnet force devices, levitation is a good place to start.

\subsection{Magnetic levitation is impossible!}
\seclabel{earnshaw}

The act of passively levitating a magnet by another is well
known as impossible, although popular unlearned opinion is not
aware of the fact.  \textcite{earnshaw1842} proved that
objects in the influence of fields that apply forces with an
inverse-square relation to displacement cannot form
configurations of stable levitation. Approximately one hundred
years later, \textcite{tonks1940} wrote a paper reminding his
contemporaries of the work of \citeauthor{earnshaw1842} by
applying the proof specifically to the field of magnetics:
\begin{quote}
\dots no flexible assemblage of magnetic poles, in which
readjustments in position of the poles in the group can
occur, can be stable in either a fixed field or in the field
from another such assemblage\dots
\end{quote}
The proof is conceptually quite simple. We start with the
equation for the magnetic field; when there are no external
current terms, it can be shown to be expressed as Laplace's
equation:
\begin{dmath}[compact]
\grad\magB = 0 \implies \divgrad\magB = 0
\end{dmath}.  
The potential energy of a magnet is proportional
to the magnetic field it is subjected to, $U =
-\magM\bdot\magB$, so when the magnetisation is time-invariant 
(as in the case of a permanent magnet), we have:
\begin{dmath}[compact,label=earnshaw]
\divgrad U = \divgradxyz{U} = 0 
\end{dmath}.  
The double differentiations of the energy are
the stiffnesses in each direction.  But for stable
equilibrium, these three terms must be greater than zero. This
cannot satisfy \eqref{earnshaw} and thus levitation cannot
occur.

\begin{figure}
  \grf[width=0.4\textwidth]{Figures/Theory/saddle}
  \caption{A ball in unstable equilibrium on a saddle-shaped curve.}
  \figlabel{saddle}
\end{figure}

This is easy to visualise by analogy. \figref{saddle} shows a ball balancing
on a saddle-shaped curve, which we can take to be potential energy of a \twoD\
system. Clearly it is stable in one direction, unstable in the other.
Perturbations `left' or `right' will result in reaction forces keeping it
centred and stable, whereas small displacements `into' or `out from' the page
will result in increased perturbation to instability.

\subsection{Exceptions to Earnshaw}

Earnshaw's proof does not rule out all forms of `levitation' unconditionally,
however. \textcite{boerdijk1956a} reviewed the known methods for levitation,
covering levitation by gravitation forces, pressure reaction forces, radiation
field forces, and finally in detail, various magnetic and electromagnetic
forces.

Because Earnshaw's theorem looks only at the case for static equilibrium,
cases when the magnetic field is dynamic are not covered. This can occur
broadly under two circumstances: when the magnetic field is generated with
\AC\ currents; and when an unstable permanent magnet arrangement is stabilised
with an active control system.

Levitation using a magnetic field produced by \AC\ currents was covered in
detail by \textcite{laithwaite1965}. The basic mechanism of this type of
levitation is that \AC\ currents create dynamic magnetic fields that induce
eddy currents in a levitating object, and it is the interaction of the
magnetic fields of these induced currents that causes the levitation. The
technique uses a large amount of power, and is not especially suitable for the
purposes of this research for this reason.

For an actively stabilised levitation system, the levitation forces are
created by permanent magnets (which have time-constant magnetic fields) and
the necessary stabilisation applied with variable current electromagnets with
a feedback control system. For this reason the magnetic fields are known as
quasi-static. This system was first implemented by Holmes who levitated a
magnetic needle, as cited by \textcite{boerdijk1956a}. Some more practical
examples of these types of system are covered in the next section.

This summary is fairly brief; \textcite{bleuler1992} wrote a more detailed
overview. His paper introduces the `self-sensing active magnetic bearing'
\cite{vischer1993} which uses back--electromotive force from the controlling
electromagnet to sense the position of the floating element. This eliminates
the need for a more classical position sensor (\eg, optical or capacitive),
but the control system is necessarily more complex and the behaviour not as
precise.

Some Italian guy showed that you can levitate a ring magnet above another by
using vibrations to find small zone of stability in the nonlinear dynamics
\cite{bassani2007}.

\subsection{Diamagnetic forces}

Levitations involving diamagnetic material are also exempt from Earnshaw's
theorem. This was the motivation for the papers of
\textcite{boerdijk1956b,boerdijk1956a} in which he cites Braunbek, who derived
that magnetic material is governed by Earnshaw's theorem only because it has a
relative magnetic permeability ($\permMag$) greater than one—\ie, a
permeability greater than that of the surrounding medium. Material with
$\permMag<1$ is \emph{not} covered by the theorem since the magnetic flux from
the diamagnetic material becomes dependent on the displacement of the
permanent magnet; this violates the condition of Earnshaw's theorem that fixed
magnetic fields be used, and so static levitation involving magnets and such
diamagnetic material is very possible. To demonstrate this,
\citeauthor{boerdijk1956b} levitated a small cylindrical magnet of dimensions
\diameter$\,\SI{1}{mm} \times \SI{0.3}{mm}$.

More contemporary studies on diamagnetic levitation look at the
levitation of larger objects including strawberries and frogs
\cite{berry1997, simon2000, simon2001}, using very high-powered
electromagnets (on the order of \SI{2}{T} \fixme{check}).

Unfortunately, these techniques are not suitable for large load
bearing.  Even the most diamagnetic substance known, pure bismuth, has
$\permMag \approx 0.9998$ — hardly different than that of air. The forces
exchanged via magnetic flux between magnetic and diamagnetic
materials, therefore, are incredibly small and not suited at all to
the purposes of this research.

Superconducting material, on the other hand, behaves ideally diamagnetic with
$\permMag =0$, so the forces produced between a superconductor and a magnet
are equal to the forces between two (equal) permanent magnets themselves. This
allows many exciting possibilities for stable levitation. However, such
materials must be cooled to very low temperatures (\emph{at least} below
\SI{-150}{\celsius}) in order to remain superconductive. Such a requirement
renders this method financially and functionally impractical for this
research. A review of work in this area has been published by
\textcite{ma2003}.

\subsection{Basic magnetic suspension}

\textcite{agamennoni2004} were able to identify the nonlinear dynamics
of a coil-iron suspension.

\section{Magnetics}
\seclabel{magnets-explore}

\subsection{Applications of magnetic forces}

\textcite{coey2002} discusses a broad range of magnetic applications,
summarised in \tabref{magnet-applications}.

\begin{table}
\begin{wide}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lll@{}}
\toprule

\tablabel{magnet-applications}
\end{table}

That magnets can apply forces to one another over a distance is quite a novel
concept in a mechanical world accustomed to friction. It has been a short
while, relatively speaking, that it has been possible to even \emph{produce}
magnets with enough coercive force to apply useful mechanical forces.
Non-contact magnetics in mechanical systems is advantageous due to high
precision and wear-free operation due to lack of friction. This section looks
broadly at some of the main applications of the field.

\subsection{Maglev transportation}

The largest body of research into magnetic levitation is on so-called `maglev'
transportation. Its well-known goal is to use a levitated train or car to
provide extremely fast and efficient transportation. This field, which is
rather diverse in terms of the techniques under investigation, is finally now
achieving commercial application in the real world after some 20 or 30 years
of research. While it has some concepts in common with this research (large
loads, magnets), the techniques used tend to be rather distanced from those
that will be applied for this project because they focus on transportation
rather than \emph{elimination} of movement.

\subsection{Magnetic actuators}

In more recent years, another application for magnetic levitation has been
investigated, which is the precision control of a levitated platform. Commonly
cited for use in the semiconductor industry for photolithography, these
levitators were first researched around 20 years ago.

The first designs allowed travel in a single direction, \eg,
\textcite{trumper1992}, while more recent developments allow more directions
of control. Such devices are capable of supporting small loads, and applying
horizontal translation forces to effect displacements of up to around
\SI{200}{mm} with nanometre precision. Two planar devices are invented in the
independent theses of \textcite{kim1997} and \textcite{molenaar2000}. Most
recently, a six degree of freedom non-contact actuator was demonstrated by
\textcite{verma2004}. See also the device built by \textcite{kim2007} to
support around \SI{2}{kg} over a travel of $\SI{5}{mm}\times\SI{5}{mm}$ with
nanometre precision. The high performance and mechanical simplicity of their
design is note-worthy.

Here're some more to look at: \textcite{boeij2008,zhang2008a}

The reason these devices are unsuitable for this research is due to their
travelling capability. Rather than using the primarly magnetic flux for load
support, these designs use it in order to provide positioning control in the
horizontal directions.

Here's something new: \textcite{shameli2008}.

A recent six degree of freedom actuator has been demonstrated
by \textcite{jansen2008}, which supports loads in the order of
\SI{10}{kg} with a relatively large air gap (\SI{1}{mm}--\SI{2}{mm}) 
and large stroke ($\SI{230}{mm}\times\SI{230}{mm}$).

[\textcite{dasilveira2005}] Analytical expression for the normal force
between two magnets on a back-iron plate and a perpendicular coil. The system
is for a planar actuator, and the motivation is to be able to determine the
amount of out-of-plane force generated by a particular design. Could very well
be useful for some of my ideas.

\subsection{Interesting devices}

I like magnetic levitation of objects in a wind tunnel
\cite{higuchi2008}.

Magnetic fields can be used for a vast array of scientific uses. For example,
noncontact sensing of material properties that involve variable conductivity,
including fatigue cracks, defects in printed circuit boards, and even plastic
landmine detection \cite{mukhopadhyay2005}.

Here would be a good place to cite the brain, nerve, stuff, etc
\parencite{lu2008,demachi2008}


Here's a fun application of magnetics where a computer input device is built
with magnetic sensors placed on the wrist in order to sense single finger-tip
motion from the opposite hand \parencite{han2008}.

I don't know if I care, but \textcite{vanwest2007} created a
haptic interface for manuipulating small objects with magnetic
levitation using the so-called `zero power' technique well
known due to Mizuno.

\textcite{park2008} demonstrates a MIMO controller for a flywheel energy
storage mechanism using magnetic bearings while applying active vibration
isolation.

\textcite{tomie2005} This paper's a bit of fun; uses a magnet attached
to a cantilever, excited by an external field in a water tank, to propel a
robotic fish. Only left-right oscillations were produced, so the fish was
constrained to move in a plane; two turning methods are investigated.


\section{Exploring \qzs\ systems}
\seclabel{qzs-explore}

Addition of negative stiffness elements in a design reduces the resonance
frequency, which improves vibration isolation. Early examples of such designs
using inclined springs were shown by \textcite{molyneux1957}. Such systems may
tuned to achieve a local region of zero stiffness, which is often termed
`\qzs'. \textcite{alabuzhev1989} looked at the nonlinear behaviour of such
systems, and also more recently by
\textcite{carrella2006,carrella2007,carrella2008} and improved by
\textcite{kovacic2008}. More recently, the dynamic response of these systems
has been analysed \parencite{carrella2009,carrella2008thesis} and shown to
have prominent nonlinearities that distort the frequency response but that do
not decrease the vibration isolation efficacy in general.

The use of buckling beams as a negative stiffness element to achieve \qzs\ has
also been implemented in practice~\cite{platus1999,tarnai2003,lee2007}.

A brief discussion of zero stiffness elements in hand-held vibrating
machinery yields perhaps little insight into our problem
\cite{sokolov2007}, but mentions that friction is the biggest problem
once zero stiffness has actually been achieved; this problem is
obviated when non-contact supports are used.

An interesting collection of literature for very low frequency vibration
isolation resulted from various gravity wave interferometers built around the
world. Some of these used the negative stiffness of the buckling beam, in
various forms, to reduce the resonance frequency of an isolator
\cite{cella2005}.

\QZS\ can also be achieved with magnetic systems. Magnetic configurations with
negative stiffness can be used to augment a positive stiffness support (which
can be simply a conventional spring) to lower the resonance frequency. For
example, \textcite{beccaria1997} used this technique (under the term `magnetic
antisprings') to improve the isolation for gravity wave detectors.
\textcite{carrella2007a,carrella2008} has also used a attractive magnets in
parallel with conventional springs to reduce the resonance frequency of the
system. Purely non-contact magnetic systems can also be used to similar effect
\cite{robertson2006,robertson2007}. Generally, systems that use the negative
stiffness between attracting magnets cannot be brought to a stable \qzs\
region due to their `softening spring' characteristic.

\textcite{hol2006} discuss a `gravity compensator' that uses the idea of an
axial bearing with \ang{90} rotated magnetisations to bear load in the
vertical direction. (Also see \textcite{yonnet1981} for related bearings that
I hadn't thought about in enough detail yet.) This creates something like a
negative quadratic force relationship, which has zero stiffness in the centred
vertical position.

Analysis of the nonlinear dynamics of such systems such as performed by
\textcite{lee2004b,kovacic2008} can be quite involved and is outside the scope
of this research.




\section{Digression on the nature of the literature}

The method for literature review taken in this thesis may be considered rather
eccentric. During the course of my research, I couldn't help but notice the
flood of literature to be an almost unstoppable flow of information that was
rather difficult to remain `on top of'. Certainly required some expenditure of
effort on my part. And perhaps to my detriment, the bibliography in this
thesis is rather large — although certainly not exceeding that of a single
literature review in certain specific fields.

This thesis is a drop of water in the ocean of this literature that is
increasing every month. It will be a defining problem in the next few decades,
I believe, to attempt a unification and consolidation of the amount of
information that is currently available and, also, and more importantly, the
way that new work is published.





\section{Notation}

The mathematics in this thesis is typeset consistently but somewhat
differently than might be expected. Here's an arbitrary example:
\begin{dmath*}
f\fn{x} = \half\gp{x+\Sin{x}}.
\end{dmath*}


Here's a nice big glossary section that will take me fucking ages to get
right. Maybe I should just scrap it.





\section{Typesetting}

The typesetting of this thesis has been carefully designed with the following main objectives:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Ease of reading content, and
\item Ease of finding information.
\end{enumerate}
For the first point, a highly legible font has been chosen and the size of the
text calculated for optimal reading properties. For the second point, the
outer margins of the page have been utilised for holding `markers' such as
equation numbers and section numbers; this places such information close the
edge of the paper to aid `flicking through' the thesis. It also moves them
away from the main text where their encroachment of the material in the main
text is less useful.

in all relevant cross-referencing situations to aid navigation.




\section{Paraphrasing David Foster Wallace}

David Foster Wallace discusses the feeling of writing a book.
\note{\url{http://www.badgerinternet.com/~bobkat/jesty.html}}
His words work equally well for a thesis:

\begin{quotation}
You love [it] very much. And you want others to love it, too, when the time
finally comes for [it] to go out and face the world. But wanting other people
to love it, now, means hoping that others somehow won't see [it] as you see it
\dash as a grotesque, malformed betrayal of the very possibilities that
spawned it. You want to sort of fool people: you want them to see as perfect
what you in your heart know is a betrayal of all perfection. Or else you don't
want to fool these people; [...] You want to be terribly wrong: you want [its]
hideousness to turn out to have been nothing but your own weird delusion or
hallucination. But that'd mean you were crazy ... But worse: it'd also mean
you see and despise hideousness in a thing you made (and love), in your spawn,
in certain ways you. But that's still what you most want: to be completely,
insanely, suicidally wrong.

But it's still all a lot of fun. Don't get me wrong.
\end{quotation}
