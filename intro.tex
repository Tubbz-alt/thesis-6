\section{Introduction to the central themes of the thesis}

Before launching into detail into the various topics under investigation, this
section briefly touches on the issues addressed over the entire thesis:
vibrations and their isolation and suppression in
\secref{vibrations-summary-intro}; permanent magnets and their role in the
design of supporting structures and other devices in
\secref{magnets-summary-intro}; and `\qzs/' systems, which unify in this thesis
the fields of vibrations and magnets, in \secref{qzs-summary-intro}.
These three broad areas are then investigated in more detail in \secrangeref{vibrations-explore}{qzs-explore}.

\subsection{The problem of vibrations}
\seclabel{vibrations-summary-intro}

The disturbing effects of vibrations are a well-known and continuing problem.
The transmission of vibrations from a source can only ever be reduced, not
eliminated — that is, not without removing the source entirely from the local
region affected.
And in many cases there is no single source; the very ground
itself may be a medium through which undesirable vibrations are transmitted.
Earthquakes are an extreme example of this, but on a smaller scale there are
continuous time-varying displacements of the `fixed' ground beneath us.
\note{Not to be too earth-centric, but many of the ideas here have a different
relevance in off-planet circumstances.} The earth should in fact be considered
as a distributed vibrating structure, of very great mass in total, that has a
range of displacement profiles dependent on the local surrounding impedance
conditions.

Whether the source of the disturbance is near or far, or how it propagates
through the ground to arrive at the region of interest, these disturbances can
cause a variety in problems on equipment that is required to, ideally, remain
absolutely still.
A good example is during the electro-lithography performed
to construct our microchips, in which nanometre-sized disturbances can affect
the overall yield of the silicon wafer produced.
Mitigating the effects of a
disturbance through the base on which a structure is supported is known as
`vibration isolation' and is the over-arching problem in which the work of
this thesis should be put in context.

A contrasting vibration problem occurs when some manner of machine causes its
own vibration; a well-known example is a washing machine that exerts an
oscillating disturbance force on itself through a mass imbalance.
This type of
vibration problem requires a rather different set of design solutions and
often its solution acts in opposition to the vibration isolation problem
discussed above.
Reducing the effects of self-induced vibration disturbance
will be termed `vibration suppression' \note{The descriptor `Vibration
isolation' is commonly used to refer to both problems, but it would be
confusing here to avoid the clarification.} for the purposes of this thesis
and will be revisited on occassion herein.

There are a variety of `classic' solutions for both vibration isolation and
vibration suppression.
A particularly simple solution for \emph{both} problems
is to mount the equipment on a many-ton slab of concrete.
This is not always
practical.
Another common approach for vibration isolation is to support the
equipment with pneumatic springs.
When in operation, these springs provide a
low supporting stiffness and low static deflection; they can typically be used
to support hundreds of kilograms with resonance frequency of less than five
hertz.

Other support methods besides pneumatics are able to achieve low stiffness;
this is an area that will be further investigated in the literature review.
But one method in particular is interesting in this context: permanent magnets
can provide low stiffness support without energy expenditure.
Their nonlinear
forces in both attraction and repulsion allows the possibility of interesting
supporting designs, and their non-contact nature allows their use in vacuum
and `clean-room' environments.

\subsection{Permanent magnets used for mechanical design}
\seclabel{magnets-summary-intro}

The last twenty years has seen the maturation of the rare earth permanent
magnet industry.
These magnets are now widely available in large sizes and
strong magnetisation at relatively low prices.
They are now used in a variety
of mechanical design, including bearings, couplings, \maglev/ trains, and so
on, which take advantage of non-contact attractive and/or repulsive forces.
Magnets can be used to make other magnets move or to keep them in place —
there is little limit to the ingenuity of their application.
However, in part
to this complex behaviour between them, there are few design guidelines that
can be used to aid their use [quote Moskowitz].

We can speak broadly about their integrated use in force design: magnets can
be used in conjunction with current-carrying coils to effect time-varying
forces (as in shakers and speakers); soft iron can be used to guide the
magnetic fields into desired regions or away from unwanted areas (\eg, latches
and motors); or magnets can be used alone for unique force--displacement
characteristics or simply for applying non-contact forces (\eg, bearings).

These ideas in mechanics and dynamics have application back to the field of
vibrations.
A `synergy' between the two fields is seen in areas such as energy
harvesting from ambient vibration, the study of vibration in high-speed
magnetic bearings, and one of the main themes of this thesis — nonlinear
and/or noncontact forces for support equipment for vibration isolation.

Support mass with a noncontact force can also be called `levitation', an area
which deserves its own mention.
\textcite{earnshaw1842} proved that levitation
with the force of permanent magnets alone was impossible, although this did
not become common knowledge \note{If it can even be said to be `commonly
known' today.
Anecdotal evidence suggests otherwise.} until much later — given
by the range of patents issued that assume the opposite.
Exceptions to
`Earshaw's Theorem' include the use of diamagnetic materials and
actively-controlled system, amongst some others.
It is the possibility of
overcoming instability with active means that is of interest in this thesis.

\subsection{\QZS/ systems}
\seclabel{qzs-summary-intro}

The transition between stable and unstable forces becomes interesting in the
context of vibration isolation.
Between positive and negative stiffness in a
force--displacement characteristic, there is a inflexion point of zero
stiffness.
This point is termed a `\qzs/' position to emphasise that the
dynamic behaviour of the system in this condition can be rather complex and
usually unstable.
`True' zero stiffness would imply \emph{no} connection
between between the mass and the base, as if they were floating in free space
— the motion of one would have no effect on the motion of the other.

As systems approach \qzs/, their vibration isolation inproves as the resonant
frequency decreases.
Operation at the \qzs/ position is not possible as the
system is, at best, only marginally stable, and the system must be tuned
(based on the applied loading) to achieve best results.

Certain magnetic systems are not the only ones to exhibit \qzs/.
The phenomenon
was first proposed using inclined springs to achieve a `buckling' effect.
Magnets are more convenient in many ways than inclined or buckling springs in
that the negative stiffness can be applied directly without having to exploit
the byproduct of a mechanical spring or linkage arrangement, which can be more
bulky.

Active control systems can be used with \qzs/ systems to improve their 
performance in one of three ways:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Standard active vibration control with velocity feedback;
  \item Remove the instability at the \qzs/ location with a nonlinear controller;
  \item Online tuning of the system for load-independent operation.
\end{enumerate}
The first two of these strategies are investigated in this thesis.

\subsection{Project context}

The original goal of this project was to design and build a vibration
isolation table using non-contact magnetic springs.
This goal can be
split into two: the design of a non-contact magnetic spring (suitable
for a vibration isolation table); and the design of the vibration
isolation table itself.

Vibration isolation tables are generally designed to attenuate natural
disturbances from the ground to the tabletop.
Current commercial models use
pneumatic springs to perform this task, and this project arose out of
curiosity: could magnetic springs be used instead?

Using magnets for load bearing brings its own set of challenges.
For completely non-contact support, active control must be used to
stabilise \emph{at least} one degree of freedom.
For the design to be
worth investigating, some advantage to using magnets should also be
demonstrated.\footnote{Although I took much pleasure in explaining
  over the years that my \PhD/ project was to `build a table that
  floats on magnets'.}

However, the field of active control has been well-established and the feat of
building a stabilising controller for a system with relatively simple dynamics
is not worthy of the research for a \PhD/.
The work presented in this thesis is
the investigations around the idea of building a `table that floats on
magnets' while pulling out enough interesting nuggets to prove worthy of the
title of `research'.

\section{Vibrations}
\seclabel{vibrations-explore}

The field of active vibration isolation is a broad topic to cover in review;
not everything will be able to be covered here, but it is important to have an
overview of what people are doing to place this work in context.
The
literature review that follows is strongly biased towards papers that have
been recently published.
Tracking their citations backwards will yield a
tangled web of prior art in the field of vibration control.

\subsection{Linear systems}

\Figref{simple-isolation} shows the simplest form of vibration
isolation in which a mass $\massMass$ is mounted with stiffness
$\stiffnessRel$ with disturbance input $\dispBase$.
Passive
isolation is achieved for zero input force, $\forceIn=0$.
Feedback
control allows the properties of the system to be adjusted
according the desired vibration response.

\begin{figure}
  \asyfig{Systems/vibration-base}
  \caption{
    Single degree of freedom vibration isolation mount; mass $\massMass$ is being isolated from disturbance $\dispBase$.
    Input force $\forceIn$ can be generated using feedforward or feedback control.}
  \figlabel{simple-isolation}
\end{figure}

The dynamic response of the isolated mass is
\begin{dmath}[label=simple-isolation]
  \massMass\ddot\dispMass +
  \dampingRel\gp{\dot\dispMass-\dot\dispBase} +
  \stiffnessRel\gp{\dispMass-\dispBase} + \forceIn = 0 .
\end{dmath}
First assume that there is no input force; taking the Laplace
tranform and rearranging produced the transmissibility
$\transmissibility$ of the system in the frequency domain:
\begin{dmath}[compact,label=simple-isolation-freq]
  \transmissibility\fn\freq = \frac{\laplaceMass}{\laplaceBase} = 
  \frac{\ii\freq\dampingRel + \stiffnessRel}
  {-\massMass\freq^2 + \ii\freq\dampingRel + \stiffnessRel}.
\end{dmath}

For ideal linear state feedback control, the input force can be
represented as a linear combination of measured relative
displacement $\gp{\dispMass-\dispBase}$, relative velocity
$\gp{\dot\dispMass-\dot\dispBase}$, and acceleration
$\ddot\dispMass$ of the mass.
Let's also assume for now that
integrating the acceleration signal yields an exact absolute
velocity $\dot\dispMass$ of the mass as well.
The generalised
feedback force can then be represented by
\begin{dmath}
 \forceIn = 
   \gainDisp\gp{\dispMass-\dispBase} + 
   \gainVel \gp{\dot\dispMass-\dot\dispBase} +
   \gainAcc \ddot\dispMass + 
   \gainSky \dot\dispMass
\end{dmath},
where $\gainArbitrary$ are feedback gains chosen appropriately for a given application.
The term involving $\gainSky$ is known as skyhook damping.
Substituting this force equation
into \eqref{simple-isolation} yields
\begin{dmath}
  \gp{\massMass+\gainAcc}\ddot\dispMass +
  \gp{\dampingRel+\gainVel}\gp{\dot\dispMass-\dot\dispBase} +
  \gp{\stiffnessRel+\gainDisp}\gp{\dispMass-\dispBase} +
  \gainSky\dot\dispMass 
  = 0
\end{dmath}.

It can be clearly seen that there is an exact equivalence between the feedback
gains of the different signals and a corresponding physical parameter of the
system.
For example, adding gain on the displacement feedback is analogous to
increasing the stiffness of the system.
The one standout here is the `skyhook'
damping term, whose influence can be better seen in the equation for
transmissibility of the closed loop system.
For this example, let displacement
and acceleration gains equal zero, $\gainDisp=\gainAcc=0$, resulting in
\begin{dmath}[compact,label=skyhook]
  \transmissibility\fn\freq = \frac{\laplaceMass}{\laplaceBase} = 
  \frac{\ii\freq\gp{\dampingRel+\gainVel} + \stiffnessRel}
    {-\massMass\freq^2 + \ii\freq\gp{\dampingRel+\gainVel+\gainSky} + \stiffnessRel}.
\end{dmath}
The transmissibilities due to the influence of relative velocity gain and
absolute velocity gain are shown in \figref{vel-vs-sky} with parameters
$\massMass=\SI{1}{kg}$, $\dampingRel=\SI{1}{kg/s}$,
$\stiffnessRel=\SI{10}{N/m}$, and the respective gains $\gainVel$ and
$\gainSky$ ranging from $0$ to $5$ corresponding from light to dark plot
lines.

\begin{figure}
   \begin{wide}
     \psfragfig{\phdpath Simulations/Springs/fig/sdof-vel}\hfil
     \psfragfig{\phdpath Simulations/Springs/fig/sdof-sky}
   \end{wide}
   \caption{Relative and absolute (`skyhook') velocity feedback control on the 
   system shown in \figref{simple-isolation}.
   Feedback gain increases as the 
   plot line ranges from light to dark.}
   \figlabel{vel-vs-sky}
\end{figure}

In comparing the \RMS\ transmissibilities over the frequency range of interest
($\sqrt{\Int{\transmissibility\fn\freq}{\freq,\freq_1,\freq_2}}$) as a function of
increasing feedback gain for the two cases, it is clear in the ideal case that
skyhook damping is more efficacious at reducing the total vibration of a
system.
This is shown in \figref{rms-transmissibility}, where the relative
feedback \RMS\ transmissiblity has a local minimum whereas the skyhook case
continuously decreases.
(The maximum frequency in this case was chosen to be
much greater than the resonance frequency;
$[\freq_1,\freq_2]=[0,\SI{1000}{rad/s}]$.)

   \caption{\RMS\ transmissibility versus feedback gain of relative and 
   absolute (`skyhook') velocity feedback control on the system shown in 
   \figref{simple-isolation}.}
   \figlabel{rms-transmissibility}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Implementing linear feedback}
\secref{vibes-feedback}

Velocity feedback control by using integrated accelerometer measurements at
the location of actuation has been used for some time as an effective
vibration isolation mechanism, shown for example by \textcite{kim1999} at the
ISVR at the University of Southampton, an institution that has been very
active in this field.

The limits of control in real-world devices was investigated by
\textcite{ananthaganeshan2001}, where time delays and phase lags introduced by
digital filters and integrators can have quite significant effects over the
ideal case of pure displacement or velocity or acceleration feedback (as
posited in the previous section).
Real integrators (as opposed to ideal
integrators) and high pass filters cause instabilities at low frequencies.
Acceleration feedback has much smaller stability limit than displacement and
velocity.
And the effect of displacement feedback is strongly reduced even
with small time delays.
Therefore velocity feedback control from integrated
accelerometer measurements should be consided the better choice.
Also, the
presence of a low pass filter does not significantly effect the efficacy of
velocity feedback.

\textcite{zhu2006} look at using such feedback in a highly sensitive
micro-gravity environment and show that `PID' feedback is unsuitable due to
instability at high (\ie, useful) control gains from quantisation and
anti-aliasing side-effects.
Rather, integral and double-integral feedback from
an accelerometer give better results for them.

\textcite{zhao2007} examined the vibratory behaviour of a two degree of
freedom nonlinear system with a time-delayed positional feedback.
This results
of this paper emphasises the importance of accounting for time delays in
feedback control systems.

\subsection{From QZS paper; to be fleshed out for the real intro}

Position/displacement feedback: \cite{mahmoodi2009}

Absolute velocity feedback control creates `skyhook' damping, in which
the resonance peak is reduced without affecting the vibration
transmission at higher frequencies~\cite{yan2006}.

For an ideal single degree of freedom system, this technique is limited by
instability caused by time delays in the
controller~\cite{ananthaganeshan2001,elliott2004,brennan2007}.

Semi-active methods have also been developed to approximate this
technique when fully active control is
undesirable~\cite{liu2002,liu2005,ahmadian2004}.
Semi-active control
has the advantages of robustness and low power requirements,
especially when large forces would be required for active control.

Reducing the stiffness of the support decreases the resonance
frequency of the system, which increases the bandwidth of vibration
isolation.
This will improve the vibration isolation of the system
over the application of sky-hook damping, especially at low
frequencies.
For a given mass, this can be achieved by reducing the
stiffness of the support, or by adding a negative stiffness element in
parallel with the system~\cite{lee2007,xing2005}.
Again, this can be
implemented by passive, active or semi-active methods.
Negative
displacement or positive acceleration feedback can be used in a fully
active system.
In the semi-active case, many methods exist to
dynamically adjust the stiffness depending on the support being used;
an example has been demonstrated by \textcite{kidner2002}.

A similar idea with a different approach is taken by
\textcite{liu2006a}, who used a permanent magnet and an electromagnet
to provide a variable stiffness in the absorber.

In a conventional mass--spring system, the static deflection increases
as the stiffness of the support is reduced, and a lower limit on the
stiffness is imposed by constraints on the allowable
displacement.
Less typical supports can exhibit stiffness that varies
nonlinearly with displacement; even local regions of zero stiffness
are possible.

An example of a system with such behaviour is a parallel
connection of vertical and inclined
springs~\cite{molyneux1957,alabuzhev1989,carrella2006,carrella2007},
which has an approximately cubic force vs.\ displacement
characteristic; localised zero stiffness occurs at zero deflection,
which is termed `\qzs/'.
The use of buckling beams as a negative
stiffness element to achieve \qzs/ has also been implemented in
practice~\cite{platus1999,tarnai2003}.

\textcite{virgin2008} proposes an interesting alternative to the
classical helical spring for vibration isolation support: a `pinched
loop' created by a slender beam with both ends clamped has a wide
range of tuning possibilities and offers isolation in two degrees of
freedom.

An example pertinent to this
research is the recent analysis by Carrella \emph{et al.} of a \qzs/
system using (positive stiffness) linear springs in parallel with negative
stiffness magnetic springs~\cite{carrella2008}.
Further detail into the
field  of nonlinear passive vibration isolators is given in the recent
review by \textcite{ibrahim2008}.

\subsection{Sensing}
\seclabel{vibration-sensing}

The sensors used for active vibration control systems can make a significant impact on the performance that the control can achieve.
\textcite{brennan2007} discuss the impacts of using displacement, velocity, and acceleration feedback for a single degree of freedom system in the context of signal conditioning filters and digital time delays in the loop.
Integrating an accelerometer signal may be a convenient method to approximate the absolute velocity, but it limits the control performance that can be achieved due to a lower frequency limit on the observed signal.

Accelerometer signals may be integrated in a number of ways.
Standard methods involve high-pass filtering the measured signal to avoid drift as integration errors accumulate.
This technique is used in, \eg, B\&K charge amplifiers which can output a velocity signal from an accelerometer.
For certain types of measurements, the high-pass filter used here can be detrimental to the signal that is being estimated.
An alternative is the use of `drift-free' integrators \cite{gavin1998}, in which the drift is compensated for using alternative signal processing methods, but this approach is only advantageous for measuring low-frequency periodic signal; for transient or wide-band signals, the typical approach is better suited.

It is always desired to minimise the number of sensors due to cost and
implementation complexity, and various methods may be used to estimate
states of a system that are not directly measured.
If displacement and
acceleration are measured, a reasonable estimate of the velocity may
be computed by differentiating and integrating, respectively, the
measured signals and combining the results.
This method has been practised by \textcite{bennett2007}, and it works acceptably well because the low frequency components can be obtained from the derivative of the displacement and the high frequency components can be obtained by integration of the acceleration.
The only question is where to draw the line in the frequency domain between the two signals.
Note, however, that laser velocity and differentiated displacement sensors measure \emph{relative} velocity to the reference frame of the sensor, but an integrated accelerometer signal measures the \emph{absolute} velocity of the object.




\subsection{Skyhook damping}
\seclabel{skyhook}

An attractive method of reducing the effects of resonance peaks is to add
damping to the structure.
If this is performed by an actuator attached to the
`sky' instead of the ground, the advantage of knocking out the resonance peak
is not counteracted by an increase in higher frequency vibration (less
roll-off), which is the case for damping control with ground-fixed actuators.
This scheme is known as `skyhook' damping.

In the context of isolating vibration of a train, \textcite{li1999} discuss
the disadvantages in tracking when applying skyhook damping for systems that
experience very low frequency (\ie, steady state) changes in the base
position, but for the purposes of vibration isolation this is not a problem if
the ground is assumed to experience disturbance with zero mean.
(They also use
Kalman filters for estimating velocity — \cf\ \secref{vibration-sensing} — but such a signal is suitable only for tracking, not for control, due to the time delay due to the processing and calculation of the resultant signal.)

A similar result \fixme{check/qualify this} can be achieved with dynamic stiffness control, which can be effected with `semi-active' variable stiffness feedback control \cite{leavitt2007}.

In the original and crude method of implementing skyhook control, the
switching mode that is necessary to emulate the `skyhook' in the controlled
damping introduces higher order (odd-multiple) harmonics in the frequency
response, as shown by \textcite{ahmadian2001}, who later proposed two
`jerk-free' skyhook algorithms \cite{ahmadian2004}.

Further work in the area was established by \textcite{liu2002}, who
demonstrated a number of skyhook-like semi-active damping methods, including
smoothing functions to eliminate the problem of jerk
\cite{liu2005}.\footnote{These references by Liu contain essentially the same
material, with greater detail in the first.
The 2005 paper is easier to read
than the 2002 Technical Memorandum simply due to the formatting of the
documents.}

Earthquake protection systems deal with a form of vibration isolation,
but focus more on transient response than continuous disturbance.
The
nature of the problem is important to analyse before control
strategies are applied.
\textcite{gavin2007} discuss using negative
stiffness and skyhook damping in the context of isolating machinery
in a building.

Skyhook damping is considered an ideal case (I need some references
— \ie, detail — for this) and is implemented with a switching
controller in practice.
This is because the abstraction of skyhook
damping is to attach a damper to the `sky' itself; that is, the added
damping is proportional to the absolute velocity of the damped
mass.
In practice, however, a velocity sensor can only measure a
\emph{relative} velocity between the mass and the position of the
fixed sensor.

\textcite{song2007} used the nonlinearities of semi-active skyhook damping as
justification for the design of an adaptive controller for vibration
isolation; they did not compare their results with recent work in the skyhook
area, however.

Skyhook damping can also be implemented with fully active control systems, an
idea explored by, \eg, \textcite{elliott2001,elliott2004,yan2006,kim2008a}
\fixme{describe these more}.
These methods are conceptually simpler, as the
inertial velocity can easily be obtained from integrated acceleration
measurements.
Instability can occur in cases when the applied control force
affects the dynamics of the base, but in practice this tends not to be a
problem for comparatively massive support structures.

\textcite{serrand2000} discuss active skyhook damping applied to a two degree
of freedom structure with emphasis on the effects, for their system, due to
possible base flexibility.
One of their results shows that using integrated
accelerometer measurements as a velocity feedback term has a low frequency
phase shift that can induce stability for high enough control gains.
Therefore, very high precision accelerometers or laser velocity vibrometers
are required for very low frequency vibration control (below \SI{1}{Hz}).


Energy generation can also be accomplished through electromagnetic damping
through induced eddy currents in a coil experiencing relative displacement to
a magnetic field, such as investigated by \textcite{graves2000}.
\Secref{damping} discusses the damping possibilities of electromagnetic
systems for the purposes of vibration isolation devices.



\subsection{Inertial actuators}

Sometimes it is not possible to integrate the control mechanism into the
support of a structure, in which case external actuators need to be added to
the device to provide the control forces.
These tend to be inertial
electromagnetic actuators, also known as `proof-mass' actuators, where the
mass of the moving element provides an external force via coupling to the
structure.
This is shown schematically in \figref{vibration-absorb}

\begin{figure}
   \asyfig{Systems/vibration-inertial} 
   \caption{An inertial force $\forceAbsorb$ designed to reduce the vibration 
   response $\dispMass$ due to disturbance $\dispBase$.
   The inertial actuator 
   has dynamics of its own ($\stiffnessAbsorb$, $\dampingAbsorb$) that 
   influence the overall vibration of the structure.}
   \figlabel{vibration-absorb}
\end{figure}

In this case, velocity feedback on its own can have problems with stability
margins at low frequencies.
\textcite{benassi2002a} (using inertial actuators)
showed in experiment that this can be improved by the addition of a phase lag
controller with force feedback in conjuection with velocity feedback.
The
theory for such `combined-state' feedback cases was subsequently developed
\cite{benassi2002b}.

A wide combination of feedback combinations was analysed by
\textcite{diaz2005} focussing on various forms of velocity feedback for
single-, double-, and multi-degree of freedom vibration isolation systems.
In
the two degree of freedom system, an inertial actuator is used to provide
control force; as well as additional stability contraints due to this
arrangement, the resonance at low frequencies of the actuator itself
compromised the control performance.

(A possible solution to this problem might be to select an actuator with a
much \emph{greater} resonance frequency than the plant, but this arrangement
has been shown to be ineffective at controlling the system
\cite[][Appendix~A]{benassi2002}.)

A comparison of some of these methods, including skyhook damping and
semi-active vibration absorber methods, was done by \textcite{huyanan2007},
contrasting the performance and implementation differences between them.

\textcite{paulitsch2003} uses an electromechanical actuator that serves as a
self-sensing device for vibration control.
The idea of self-sensing for
magnetic levitation purposes (in both cases using a electromagnet) has been
shown by \textcite{bleuler1992,vischer1993}.
These self-sensing devices
(perhaps obviously, since the \backemf/ is such a noisy
signal) do not perform nearly as well as when using a dedicated sensor, but
the technique is particularly interesting for low-cost, low-precision devices.



\subsection{Vibration neutralisers}

One method of reducing vibration on a supported mass is to attach a
supplementary mass that resonanates in concert with the disturbance; this has
the effect of adding an anti-resonance to the original system at the frequency
of interest.
These are known under various names as `tuned mass dampers',
`vibration neutralisers', `dynamic vibration absorbers', and so on.
\note{No effort has been made to compile an exhaustive list.} 
The descriptions
involving such terms as `damper' and `absorber' are not strictly accurate on
the grounds that these devices do not act as energy dissipators; rather, they
direct energy into a subsystem for which continuous disturbance is not
undesirable.
In this thesis, the term `\vibneut/' is used, following
\textcite{kidner1998} and others.

The concept of \vibneut/{}s is not entirely the focus of this research, but
falls into the category of literature that crops up in association with it.
In
the passive application, a \vibneut/\ consists of attaching a supplementary
mass to the structure for which vibration is to be removed.
The stiffness of
the attachment is chosen by matching the natural frequencies of the structure
with that of the additional mass.
This is shown in \figref{tuned-mass-vs-fig}
where a response is shown for a range of stiffness values.
There is a
compromise between broad- and narrow-band vibration attentuation.
\Figref{inertial-trans-delta} illustrates the vibration attenuation at
resonance for a system with a vibration absorber.
It can be seen that for
narrowband reduction, low absorber damping produces greater vibration
attenuation.
Conversely, if the \RMS\ transmissiblity of the entire frequency
band is calculated, as shown in \figref{rms-inertial}, it can be seen that
lower absorber damping \emph{decreases} the overall vibration reduction.

\caption{A comparison of the effects of changing the damping ratio of the 
absorber on single-frequency and broadband transmissibility of a \vibneut/.}
\end{figure}

\textcite{brennan2006} discusses a wide variety of actuators that may
be used to construct such a device:
\begin{quote}
  There is not a single ``best'' way of making an [adaptive tuned
  vibration absorber].
  It depends upon the required frequency range,
  the agility (speed of reaction) and cost.
\end{quote}

The efficacy of a \vibneut/\ is related to the damping between
it and the structure; better results are achieved with lower damping, as shown
in \figref{rms-inertial}.
The damping of the absorber can be reduced with an
active control system as shown by \textcite{kidner1998}.
This can be
understood with the realisation that energy is not dissipated by the vibration
`absorber'; rather, motional energy from the vibrating structure is being
\emph{transferred} to the supplementary mass, and this process is degraded by
the presence of damping.
\note{This theme of the desirability of low mechanical damping re-occurs at other points in this thesis (crossref).}

\Vibneut/\ are tuned for a specific resonance frequency, which means that the
frequency of the input disturbance must be known and unvarying for a passive
device to achieve useful results.
Especially for low-damping neutralisers,
their efficacy decreases rapidly as they become de-tuned.
To avoid the problem
of slow variations in the input disturbance, semi-active methods can be used
to observe the frequency of the disturbance and adjust the resonance frequency
of the neutraliser to remain tuned.
Such neutralisers typically use a variable
stiffness element, which can take many forms
\cite{ting-kong1999,kidner2002,holdhusen2007}.
An interesting device is shown
by \cite{ivers2008} that can be described as a mechanically self-tuning
vibration neutraliser.
While not as efficacious as an adaptive \vibneut/\ that
uses an external power source, the ability to adapt to the excitation
frequency using only the energy of the disturbance itself is commendable if
somewhat esoteric.

When electrical circuits are used to absorb resonant vibrations, the energy
absorbed can be redirected to produce a power output \cite{stephen2006}.
Such
devices are gaining popularity for ambient vibration--powered applications
such as remote sensing \cite{arnold2007}.
Another field of interest for
regenerative damping is in vehicle suspensions, in which useable power can be
extracted with the same mechanism as providing greater ride comfort
\cite{graves2000thesis}.

Exactly analogously to \vibneut/, semi-active methods have been explored to tune energy harvesting devices to the frequency of disturbance.
\textcite{challa2008} investigated a semi-active device for tunable energy harvesting that used variable-displacement attractive and repulsive magnets to adjust the resonance frequency of a piezoelectric cantilever.
This is the same mechanism that is examined in this thesis for `\qzs/' suspensions (see \secref{qzs-explore} and \secref{qzs}).

\textcite{stephen2006} performed a thorough analysis on energy harvesting with micro-actuators.
He considered a single degree of freedom mass-spring-damper coupled with a simple electrical circuit.
For best performance, energy should be dissipated as much as possible by the electric components, not the mechanical damping, since in the electrical network the energy is retrievable whereas as viscous damping the energy is dissipated as heat.
This is the same idea as discussed in \secref{vibneut}, in which the effectiveness of the \vibneut/ is reduced with the presence of increased mechanical damping.

\textcite{mann2008} performed a preliminary investigation into the use of a
nonlinear vibration mount for energy harvesting, using a magnetic suspension
of repulsive magnets to create a Duffing-like oscillator.
Large damping
ensured that the nonlinear regimes were only realised at large excitation
amplitudes, but the idea is that highly nonlinear resonances have a much
broader resonance peak through the higher branch around the jump phenomenon.
\fixme{reference this elsewhere}

A similar idea is explored by \textcite{shahruz2008} for an energy scavenging
cantilever beam that uses an arrangement of attracting magnets to shape the
force characteristic of the response.
The aim is to achieve a power spectrum
of the response to a random excitation that is greater than the predominantly
linear response that is obtained without the magnets present.
No analysis of 
damping or energy harvesting potential was explored in this paper.

\Vibneut/\ can also be used for modal systems, in which case each
neutraliser is designed at the specific resonance frequency of each mode.
In a
recent example, \textcite{casciati2007} used a semi-active neutraliser to
control vibration of a suspended cable; some care was required for their
structure as their higher frequency (often nonlinear) behaviour can pose an
influence even as the targeted (low frequency) mode is damped as desired.
Optimization techniques can be used, if the mode shapes are known, to place
multiple \vibneut/s in a modal system \cite{petit2009}.

\Vibneut/\ are occasionally used to mitigate seismic vibrations
in large buildings, but their mass dependence makes their application rather
tricky and often impractical.
\textcite{matta2008} propose a nonlinear
rolling structure via which a \vibneut/\ can be mounted to good effect
despite uncertain masses of either or both of the building and absorber.
Their
work focuses on the novel idea of using a roof-top garden as a \vibneut/\ for
a building \cite{matta2008a}.

Some researchers have looked at using electromagnetic actuators to provide a
fully active force with which to cancel system resonances
\cite{chen2005a,wu2007,kim2008a}.
The advantage for such a system is the same
as for semi-active controllers in general: with a suitable algorithm, changes
in the plant can be taken into account in the vibration neutraliser.
However,
using a fully active system for this task is not very energy efficient, since
all `damping' is achieved artificially with the expenditure of actuator
energy.
Nonetheless, good results can be obtained via this method and the
potential flexibility of the control system could be a good reason to design
such a system.

\subsection{Higher-level control}

Vibration isolation can be considered exclusively as a control
problem.
\textcite{guo2005}, for example, used system identification
and a variety of feedforward/feedback control techqniques to isolate a
multi-degree of freedom structure in a single direction.
Adaptive
control in six degrees of freedom for broadband noise has also been
shown by \textcite{duindam2005}.

\textcite{balandin1998} review the field of optimal control as applied
to shock and vibration isolation problems.\footnote{Their comment that the
  \enquote{number of papers is so great that there is little incentive to
  discuss them here} does not bode well for any attempts by me to
  even summarise their review.} 
  They differentiate shock and vibration isolation succintly:
\begin{quote}
  The operating quality of shock isolators is usually described in
  terms of certain characteristics of the transient motion of the body
  being isolated, whereas the quality of vibration isolators is
  determined by the characteristics of steady-state forced
  oscillations.
\end{quote}
That is, optimising for shock will result in minimising, say, the peak
displacement of the mass, whereas optimising for vibration will result
in a low natural frequency (characterised by a minimum achievable
\RMS\ displacement).
Since an optimal controller is based around a
cost function that will be dependent both on the vibratory system
itself and the mode of disturbance (transient, broadband noise, \etc),
such control approaches are heavily case-specific and are best used
when a plant is pre-determined and a vibration problem needs to be
considered after the fact.
\textcite{bolotnik2001} discusses these
methods in more detail.

I haven't finished reading the paper by \textcite{savaresi2007}, but
it's about a combination skyhook/acceleration-feedback controller that
is really nice.
It is in the context of vehicle vibration control for
ride `smoothness'; the premise is that skyhook damping knocks out
resonance peaks (without any other side-effects; \cf\ relative
velocity feedback) while acceleration ($\equiv$ `mass') feedback
decreases the overall transmissibility at higher frequencies.



\textcite{kerber2007} modelled a plate-plate coupling through four
contact points in six degrees of freedom system and applied active
vibration isolation in the vertical direction using a range of control
methods.
Of those trialed, \Hinf/ control had the best low frequency
response, and \PI\ control (with anti-windup) the best high
frequency response.
Output feedback, state feedback with an observer,
and velocity feedback methods all performed worse to various extents.

\textcite{chen2007} used \Hinf/ control to suppress the resonance peak at
around \SI{3}{Hz} of a pneumatic vibration isolation mount.
Very good
reductions in transmissibility were achieved; this technique highlights the
appeal of vibration control using an isolator with a damped resonance.

A modern look at output feedback methods is shown by \cite{mottershead2008},
where the dynamics of complex structures are altered via robust pole-placement
techniques that do not require models of the system.

And here's a method using delayed acceleration feedback by
\textcite{chatterjee2008}.


In a recent paper, \textcite{madkour2007} compare a slew of nonlinear
`artifical intelligence' adaptive algorithms to observe the parameters
of a vibrating pinned beam in order to apply feedback cancelation.
Such techniques are appropriate when system identification is required
during operation; \ie, when the plant cannot be measured beforehand or
it slowly changes over time.
However, such `artifical intelligence'
algorithms are probably sub-optimal for the observation of such a
dynamics problem when the system can be broadly modelled as a set of
differential equations in the time domain, for which in even complex systems,
nonlinear techniques such as backstepping or sliding mode control are 
often directly suitable.
Leave the heuristic approaches to systems that cannot be
modelled (or even simulated for a broad range of operating behaviours) through standard means.
\note{Note that these comments only apply to the use of such methods in
  the control phase of vibration control; genetic algorithms, \eg,
  provide a useful technique in the design phase when limited numbers of
  sensors and actuators must be placed in `optimal' positions on a
  complex structure \cite{simpson2003,howard2005}.}
  
  

\subsection{Internal resonances}

Idealised models assume system properties that are independent: a spring has
no mass, a damper has no stiffness, \etc.
In practise, however, such
simplifications can be far from actual, and internal resonances of actuators
and neutralisers can decrease the performance of their intended vibration
isolation mechanisms.

\textcite{du2003thesis} examined the effect of additional dynamics
from \vibneut/s and the consequence that had on the
transmissibility and noise radiation of the structure under
control.
While these additional high frequency dynamics would not be a
problem for certain problems (and the effects were worse in
viscoelastic-type springs; \ie, rubber springs over mechanical springs),
their effect must be considered for high-sensitivity vibration control
and cases where it is important to minimise radiated sound.
In his
thesis he proposes methods to work around the internal resonance
problem using both passive and active means.

\textcite{wu2006} analysed the vibration response of a spring-mass-damper in
which the spring element had some inertial effect on the structure due to its
mass.
The results presented show only a small magnification of the vibration
amplitude transmitted to the primary mass, particularly for small spring
relative masses; however, for highly sensitive equipment this phenomenom
should not be neglected.

Such internal resonance effects discussed above can be completely avoided by
using noncontact magnetic springs instead.
On the other hand, the nonlinear
force/displacement relationship of magnetic springs will have some nonlinear
behaviour that could affect the vibration properties of such springs in other
ways.
An example of this behaviour is demonstrated in
\secref[vref]{qzs-not-zerk}.


\subsection{Isolation tables are more than just single degree of freedom}

The issue of selecting appropriate control gains for velocity feedback control
systems was examined by \textcite{engels2008} for the cases of centralised and
decentralised control devices.
In centralised control, a global model of the
system is used when allocating the feedback signals.
In decentralised control,
each sensor/actuator pair operates independently to minimize the energy at the
mounting point.
Generally centralised control is more difficult in practise
but can give better results.
For the simple two-degree of freedom vibrating
system examined by \textcite{engels2008}, the centralised control performed
better although the differences to the decentralised control were small.
An
analogous result was shown by \textcite{hoque2006} for a three-axis vibration
platform supported by a so-called `infinite stiffness' magnet/spring system (see \secref{infstiff}).

\textcite{yoshioka2001} designed and built a prototype vibration isolation
platform with a load bearing capacity about \SI{1000}{kg}.
Their device used a
combination of pneumatic, voice-coil linear motors, and piezoelectric
actuators to control the first half dozen vibration modes of the platform.
Feedback velocity of the table and feedforward velocity and displacement of
the floor were used as control signals (with integrated accelerometer
measurements), and a genetic algorithm was used to generate a set of control gains for the system.

\subsection{Nonlinear systems}

A very recent and comprehensive review of nonlinear vibration
isolation systems for a broad range of techniques was published by
\textcite{ibrahim2008}.
It highlights the importance of nonlinear
analysis in this field: in some cases, better results can achieved
by using nonlinear spring forces to couple to and absorb vibration
energy (\fixme{eg}); in other cases, the behaviour of an isolator
cannot be adequately modelled by using linear systems theory.

Interesting results have been shown using nonlinear springs to attach the
vibration absorber to the structure, such as \textcite{jo2008} who use
repulsive magnetic springs to produce a tuned absorber with a resonance at
double the frequency of the main resonance of the structure.
\fixme{Why would
you do this?!}

\textcite{zhang2008} use a nonlinear damper (specifically of the form viscous
plus cubic with velocity; \ie, $a_1\dot x\fn{t}+a_3\ddot x^3\fn{t}$) to excite
the structure at harmonic frequencies of the resonance.
This results in less
energy at the frequency of vibration, although the resonance peak does remain.
While it does not seem likely that this method can compete with the reductions
seen with the approach of a \vibneut/, this nonlinear damping
method does have the advantage that it does not require tuning for a
particular frequency and its effectiveness will not change with a time-varying
resonance frequency.

\textcite{starosvetsky2008}, with a good
review of the literature, talk about the `nonlinear energy sink' idea in which
a nonlinear system provides better and broader vibration absorbing.

Various combinations of magnetic springs create different classes of
approximate nonlinear oscillators, for which standard methods exist to analyse
their behaviour \fixme{can I cite a book here I haven't read?}.
The
characteristic property of nonlinear springs is their exhibition of so-called
`jump phenomena' whereby the frequency response curve can take multiple values
at a single frequency, depending on the initial conditions.

\textcite{jazar2006} analysed the behaviour of a nonlinear vibration isolation mount in detail, developing analytical models for the jump phenomena of a system with cubic stiffness and quadratic damping.
Critical values were illustrated to avoid the ill effects of the nonlinearities; additional damping had the general effect of decreasing the adverse nonlinear response.

For the purpose of vibration control, augmenting a linear spring system with nonlinear magnetic springs alters the behaviour of the natural frequency of the system to be weakly coupled to the mass of the system.
\textcite{dangola2006} analysed the nonlinear dynamics of a nonlinear system in which a variation of both stiffness and mass by up to 50\% yields an increase of stiffness of 6\%.
For an equivalent linear system, the natural frequency variation is ten times greater.
This is a very interesting result for loading elements for which the mass to be supported is largely variable, in that the frequency response will vary significantly less than for conventional linear springs.

However, for weakly nonlinear magnetic springs, variation in the mass will
still lead to changes in the resonance frequency.
\textcite{todaka2001}
created a mechanical linkage to support two magnets in repulsion such that as
their air gap increased (due to less mass being supported), a horizontal
offset between them was created to lower the linearised operating stiffness.
This allowed a much smaller variation between the $k/m$ ratio than for flush
magnets in repulsion.

\textcite{bonisoli2007} used an experimental rig to analyse the nonlinear
behaviour of a magnetic and linear spring in parallel, with more theoretical
analysis published later in the year \cite{bonisoli2007b}.
They showed a
configuration of linear and magnetic springs with the notable feature that the
resonance frequency exhibits little dependence on mass loading and nonlinear
effects can be seen.
This effect was further demonstrated in parallel research
by the same authors.

The field of nonlinear dynamics is very large, and applications to vibration
suppression can result in surprising results.
\textcite{oueini1999} considered
the response of a nonlinear (including cubic) plant with an additional cubic
nonlinear feedback law and established that vibration attenuation was possible
(like a \vibneut/?) and that nonlinear phenomena such as chaos existed.
Presumably, such phenomena are undesirable for vibration isolation!


\cite{zuo2004}

Anyway, it is an interested argument to make that digital control in a
vibration isolation situation is inappropriate.
When absence of all
vibrations are required, the side-effects of digital control (\ie,
chaotic effects due to quantisation and time delays
\cite{csernak2007}) may prove deleterious for extreme applications.
On
the other hand, any sufficiently expensive system should be able to
reduce these effects to be arbitrarily negligible.
For the purposes of
this thesis, such small effects are of no concern.


Nonlinear control is better than linear control, as argued cogently by
\textcite{kokotovic1992}.
\textcite{queiroz2007} used nonlinear
control to stabilise a magnetic bearing with pull--pull electromagnets
with parameter uncertainties, while also minimising power consumption
of the system.


\subsection{Exploring \qzs/ systems}
\seclabel{qzs-explore}

Addition of negative stiffness elements in a design reduces the resonance
frequency, which improves vibration isolation.
Early examples of such designs
using inclined springs were shown by \textcite{molyneux1957}.
Such systems may
tuned to achieve a local region of zero stiffness, which is often termed
`\qzs/'.
\textcite{alabuzhev1989} looked at the nonlinear behaviour of such
systems, and also more recently by
\textcite{carrella2006,carrella2007,carrella2008} and improved by
\textcite{kovacic2008}.
More recently, the dynamic response of these systems
has been analysed \parencite{carrella2009,carrella2008thesis} and shown to
have prominent nonlinearities that distort the frequency response but that do
not decrease the vibration isolation efficacy in general.

The use of buckling beams as a negative stiffness element to achieve \qzs/ has
also been implemented in practice~\cite{platus1999,tarnai2003,lee2007}.

A brief discussion of zero stiffness elements in hand-held vibrating
machinery yields perhaps little insight into our problem
\cite{sokolov2007}, but mentions that friction is the biggest problem
once zero stiffness has actually been achieved; this problem is
obviated when non-contact supports are used.

An interesting collection of literature for very low frequency vibration
isolation resulted from various gravity wave interferometers built around the
world.
Some of these used the negative stiffness of the buckling beam, in
various forms, to reduce the resonance frequency of an isolator
\cite{cella2005}.

\QZS/ can also be achieved with magnetic systems.
Magnetic configurations with
negative stiffness can be used to augment a positive stiffness support (which
can be simply a conventional spring) to lower the resonance frequency.
For
example, \textcite{beccaria1997} used this technique (under the term `magnetic
antisprings') to improve the isolation for gravity wave detectors.
\textcite{carrella2007a,carrella2008} has also used a attractive magnets in
parallel with conventional springs to reduce the resonance frequency of the
system.
Purely non-contact magnetic systems can also be used to similar effect
\cite{robertson2006,robertson2007}.
Generally, systems that use the negative
stiffness between attracting magnets cannot be brought to a stable \qzs/
region due to their `softening spring' characteristic.

\textcite{hol2006} discuss a `gravity compensator' that uses the idea of an
axial bearing with \ang{90} rotated magnetisations to bear load in the
vertical direction.
(Also see \textcite{yonnet1981} for related bearings that
I hadn't thought about in enough detail yet.)
This creates something like a
negative quadratic force relationship, which has zero stiffness in the centred
vertical position.

Analysis of the nonlinear dynamics of such systems such as performed by \textcite{lee2004b,kovacic2008,kovacic2009} can be quite involved and is outside the scope of this research.



\subsection{(Quasi)--infinite stiffness systems}
\seclabel{infstiff}

Both \textcite{nijsse2001} and \textcite{mizuno2003a} (with related
publications) talk about using a combination of a positive and
negative stiffness springs to achieve affects like
\begin{dmath*}[compact]
  k_T = \frac{ k_1 k_2 }{ k_1 + k_2 } = \infty 
  \condition{when $ k_2 = -k_1 $.}
\end{dmath*}

\textcite{xing2005} formalises this idea in their paper.
A swath of papers
have been published by Mizuno over the years
\cite{mizuno2001,mizuno2002,mizuno2003a,mizuno2003b,mizuno2007}.
The work was
extended by \textcite{hoque2006} for three degree of freedom vibration
control using the same ideas.
The term `infinite stiffness' is perhaps
unfortunate, as it's not true in any useful sense of the term.
That is, their
static behaviour converges to something that looks like infinite stiffness,
but \emph{dynamically} they're the same as any other structure.
This is
because the negative spring in combination must be stabilised somehow, and
this stabilisation removes the nice property of summing to zero with the other
stiffness in the system.

\textcite{mizuno2003c} present a modified version of the idea, whereby
rather than using magnetic springs in attraction, as in their other work, this
paper looks at using a voice coil actuator with designed negative stiffness.
A controller must be used to obtain this negative stiffness.


\subsection{Summary of the vibrations literature}





\section{Levitation}
\seclabel{levitation-explore}

Before looking at the general class of magnet force devices, levitation is a
good place to start.

\subsection{Magnetic levitation is impossible!}
\seclabel{earnshaw}

The act of passively levitating a magnet by another is well known as
impossible, although popular unlearned opinion is not aware of the fact.
\textcite{earnshaw1842} proved that objects in the influence of fields that
apply forces with an inverse-square relation to displacement cannot form
configurations of stable levitation.
Approximately one hundred years later,
\textcite{tonks1940} wrote a paper reminding his contemporaries of the work of
\citeauthor{earnshaw1842} by applying the proof specifically to the field of
magnetics:
\begin{quote} 
\dots no flexible assemblage of magnetic poles, in which readjustments in
position of the poles in the group can occur, can be stable in either a fixed
field or in the field from another such assemblage\dots
\end{quote}
The proof is conceptually quite simple.
We start with the equation for the
magnetic field; when there are no external current terms, it can be shown to
be expressed as Laplace's equation:
\begin{dmath}[compact]
\grad\magB = 0 \implies \divgrad\magB = 0
\end{dmath}.
The potential energy of a magnet is proportional
to the magnetic field it is subjected to, $U =
-\magM\bdot\magB$, so when the magnetisation is time-invariant 
(as in the case of a permanent magnet), we have:
\begin{dmath}[compact,label=earnshaw]
\divgrad U = \divgradxyz{U} = 0 
\end{dmath}.
The double differentiations of the energy are the stiffnesses in each
direction.
But for stable equilibrium, these three terms must be greater than
zero.
This cannot satisfy \eqref{earnshaw} and thus levitation cannot occur.

\begin{figure}
  \grf[width=0.4\textwidth]{Figures/Theory/saddle}
  \caption{A ball in unstable equilibrium on a saddle-shaped curve.}
  \figlabel{saddle}
\end{figure}

This is easy to visualise by analogy.
\figref{saddle} shows a ball balancing
on a saddle-shaped curve, which we can take to be potential energy of a \twoD/
system.
Clearly it is stable in one direction, unstable in the other.
Perturbations `left' or `right' will result in reaction forces keeping it
centred and stable, whereas small displacements `into' or `out from' the page
will result in increased perturbation to instability.

\subsection{Exceptions to Earnshaw}

Earnshaw's proof does not rule out all forms of `levitation' unconditionally,
however.
\textcite{boerdijk1956a} reviewed the known methods for levitation,
covering levitation by gravitation forces, pressure reaction forces, radiation
field forces, and finally in detail, various magnetic and electromagnetic
forces.

Because Earnshaw's theorem looks only at the case for static equilibrium,
cases when the magnetic field is dynamic are not covered.
This can occur
broadly under two circumstances: when the magnetic field is generated with
\AC/ currents; and when an unstable permanent magnet arrangement is stabilised
with an active control system.

Levitation using a magnetic field produced by \AC/ currents was covered in
detail by \textcite{laithwaite1965}.
The basic mechanism of this type of
levitation is that \AC/ currents create dynamic magnetic fields that induce
eddy currents in a levitating object, and it is the interaction of the
magnetic fields of these induced currents that causes the levitation.
The
technique uses a large amount of power, and is not especially suitable for the
purposes of this research for this reason.

For an actively stabilised levitation system, the levitation forces are
created by permanent magnets (which have time-constant magnetic fields) and
the necessary stabilisation applied with variable current electromagnets with
a feedback control system.
For this reason the magnetic fields are known as
quasi-static.
This system was first implemented by Holmes who levitated a
magnetic needle, as cited by \textcite{boerdijk1956a}.
Some more practical
examples of these types of system are covered in the next section.

This summary is fairly brief; \textcite{bleuler1992} wrote a more detailed
overview.
His paper introduced the `self-sensing active magnetic bearing'
\cite{vischer1993} which uses \backemf/ from the controlling
electromagnet to sense the position of the floating element.
This eliminates
the need for a more classical position sensor,
 \note{See \secref[vref]{xpmt-sensors} for a more detailed discussion of position sensors for non-contact purposes.}
but the control system is necessarily more complex and the behaviour not as
precise.

Some Italian guy showed that you can levitate a ring magnet above another by
using vibrations to find a small zone of stability in the nonlinear dynamics
\cite{bassani2007}.

Finally, the Levitron toy demonstrates stability of a magnetic spinning top above a ring magnet \cite{berry1997,berry1996,simon1997}.

\subsection{Diamagnetic forces}

Levitations involving diamagnetic material are also exempt from Earnshaw's
theorem.
This was the motivation for the papers of
\textcite{boerdijk1956b,boerdijk1956a} in which he cites Braunbek, who derived
that magnetic material is governed by Earnshaw's theorem only because it has a
relative magnetic permeability ($\permMag$) greater than one — \ie, a
permeability greater than that of the surrounding medium.
A separate analysis of magnetic levitation systems provides a more specific measure for testing the stability of magnetic systems with various boundary conditions \cite{reusch1994}.
Material with $\permMag<1$ is \emph{not} covered by the theorem since the magnetic flux from
the diamagnetic material becomes dependent on the displacement of the
permanent magnet; this violates the condition of Earnshaw's theorem that fixed
magnetic fields be used, and so static levitation involving magnets and such
diamagnetic material is very possible.
To demonstrate this,
\citeauthor{boerdijk1956b} levitated a small cylindrical magnet of dimensions
\diameter$\,\SI{1}{mm} \times \SI{0.3}{mm}$.

More contemporary studies on diamagnetic levitation look at the levitation of
larger objects including strawberries and frogs \cite{berry1997, simon2000,
simon2001}, using very high-powered electromagnets (on the order of \SI{2}{T}
\fixme{check}).

Unfortunately, these techniques are not suitable for large load bearing.
Even
the most diamagnetic substance known, pure bismuth, has $\permMag \approx
0.9998$ — hardly different than that of air.
The forces exchanged via magnetic
flux between magnetic and diamagnetic materials, therefore, are incredibly
small and not suited at all to the purposes of this research.

Superconducting material, on the other hand, behaves ideally diamagnetic with $\permMag =0$, so the forces produced between a superconductor and a magnet are equal to the forces between two (equal) permanent magnets themselves.
This allows many exciting possibilities for stable levitation.
However, even the so-called `high temperature' superconducting materials must be cooled to very low temperatures in order to remain superconductive.
Such a requirement renders this method financially and functionally impractical for this research.
A review of work in the area of superconducting levitation has been published by \textcite{ma2003}.

\subsection{Basic magnetic suspension}

\textcite{agamennoni2004} were able to identify the nonlinear dynamics
of a coil-iron suspension.

\subsection{Non-contact magnetic support}

\textcite{puppin2002} published a paper that most plainly demonstrates that
magnetic springs can be used for vibration isolation, in which the authors
make no attempt to achieve contactless suspension—the magnets are horizontally
constrained in guides.
Furthermore, the springs are only used as passive
isolators for vibrations in the vertical direction; no active control is used.
Nonetheless, their passive spring was still capable of significant vertical
vibration attenuation.

\textcite{nagaya1993} constructed a non-contact vibration isolation table;
they report a high-stiffness spring with transmissibility approaching zero
\fixme{?}.
Their table used small magnets in a simple design, which could not
support large loads.
The authors showed later a better control system for
their `perfect noncontact active vibration isolation table'
\cite{nagaya1995a}—which refers strictly to the efficiency of their control
system and not the load-bearing abilities of the table.

\textcite{watanabe1996} wrote a paper detailing a functional vibration
isolator using electromagnetic springs, which could support weights of up to
\SI{200}{kg}.
The control system used was quite advanced, utilising a
combination of two independent control systems for stable levitation and
robust vibration isolation.
The magnetic actuator design is not described,
however.
It is believed that high-powered electromagnets were required for
this design; with the current availability of cheap rare-earth magnets, a more
efficient design is now possible.

\textcite{chang2001} applied nonlinear control to the problem of magnetic
levitation, using coupled hybrid magnets (\ie, electromagnets biased with
permanent magnet cores) that create a magnetic circuit with the levitated
table of \SI{20}{kg}.
The paper looks at nonlinear analysis and neither
passive nor active vibration isolation results are shown.

\textcite{choi2003} designed a levitation table capable of supporting
\SI{15}{kg} that is unstable in only one horizontal degree of freedom.
However, the magnetic arrangement used for the spring, despite their claims,
appears quite unstable and is not suited for scaling up to bear greater loads.
Their experiments prove that only a single axis requires control for
stability, but the position resolution they achieve is fairly coarse.

A novel design for achieving a theoretically infinite stiffness spring is
shown by \textcite{mizuno2003a,mizuno2003b}.
By using physical springs in
series with electromagnetic suspension springs, three degrees of freedom of an
isolation platform are actively controlled, with the total weight supported
around \SI{30}{kg}.
The unstable degree of freedom is in the vertical
direction, however, which may prove problematic when increasing the load on
the table.

Even now, basic \PID\ control is still used for control purposes.
\textcite{li2007} report their success in suspending a magnetic table using a
coupled electromechanical model of the system.

\textcite{banerjee2008} used a simple cascaded \PI\ and lead controllers to
stabilise an electromagnetic suspension.
An optimisation technique was used to
obtain the control gains necessary to achieve adequate performance over a
range of displacement gaps; such control is usually only suitable for
fixed-gap systems.

\textcite{gosiewski2008} applied \Hinf/ control to a magnetic suspension.
Eh.

\subsection{Applications of magnetic forces}

\textcite{coey2002} discusses a broad range of magnetic applications,
summarised in \tabref{magnet-applications}.

\end{table}

That magnets can apply forces to one another over a distance is quite a novel
concept in a mechanical world accustomed to friction.
It has been a short
while, relatively speaking, that it has been possible to even produce
magnets with enough coercive force to apply useful mechanical forces.
Non-contact magnetics in mechanical systems is advantageous due to high
precision and wear-free operation due to lack of friction.
This section looks
broadly at some of the main applications of the field.

\subsection{Maglev transportation}

The largest body of research into magnetic levitation is on so-called `\maglev/'
transportation, reviewed in 2006 by \textcite{lee2006}.
Its well-known goal is to use a levitated train or car to
provide extremely fast and efficient transportation.
This field, which is
rather diverse in terms of the techniques under investigation, is finally now
achieving commercial application in the real world after some 20 or 30 years
of research.
While it has some concepts in common with this research (large
loads, magnets), the techniques used tend to be rather distanced from those
that will be applied for this project because they focus on transportation
rather than \emph{elimination} of movement.

Earnshaw's theorem for stability is not applicable for \maglev/ systems, since the motion of the vehicle adds a time-varying element to the magnetic system.
Many approaches to the design of \maglev/ systems have been taken, including passively stable designs \cite{musolino2009}.

\subsection{Magnetic positioners}

In more recent years, another application for magnetic levitation has been
investigated, which is the precision control of a levitated platform.
Commonly
cited for use in the semiconductor industry for photolithography, these
levitators were first researched around 20 years ago, and the field is still an active area of research \cite{fulford2008,fulford2009}.

The first designs allowed travel in a single direction, \eg,
\textcite{trumper1992}, while more recent developments allow more directions
of control.
Such devices are capable of supporting small loads, and applying
horizontal translation forces to effect displacements of up to around
\SI{200}{mm} with nanometre precision.
Two planar devices are invented in the
independent theses of \textcite{kim1997} and \textcite{molenaar2000}.
Most
recently, a six degree of freedom non-contact actuator was demonstrated by
\textcite{verma2004}.
See also the device built by \textcite{kim2007} to
support around \SI{2}{kg} over a travel of $\SI{5}{mm}\times\SI{5}{mm}$ with
nanometre precision.
The high performance and mechanical simplicity of their
design is note-worthy.

Here're some more to look at: \textcite{boeij2008,zhang2008a}

The reason these devices are unsuitable for this research is due to their
travelling capability.
Rather than using the primarly magnetic flux for load
support, these designs use it in order to provide positioning control in the
horizontal directions.

Here's something new: \textcite{shameli2008}.

A recent six degree of freedom actuator has been demonstrated
by \textcite{jansen2008}, which supports loads in the order of
\SI{10}{kg} with a relatively large air gap (\SI{1}{mm}--\SI{2}{mm}) 
and large stroke ($\SI{230}{mm}\times\SI{230}{mm}$).

[\textcite{dasilveira2005}] Analytical expression for the normal force
between two magnets on a back-iron plate and a perpendicular coil.
The system
is for a planar actuator, and the motivation is to be able to determine the
amount of out-of-plane force generated by a particular design.
Could very well
be useful for some of my ideas.

\subsection{Interesting devices}


I like magnetic levitation of objects in a wind tunnel \cite{higuchi2008}.

Here would be a good place to cite the brain, nerve, stuff, etc
\parencite{lu2008,demachi2008}

Measurements of memory encoding in the brain \cite{gjini2005}.

Measurements of the health of the heart \cite{lim2009}.

Stimulation of the human nervous system \cite{darabant2009}.

Magnetic fields can be used for a vast array of scientific uses.
For example,
noncontact sensing of material properties that involve variable conductivity,
including fatigue cracks, defects in printed circuit boards, and even plastic
landmine detection \cite{mukhopadhyay2005}.

Here's a fun application of magnetics where a computer input device is built
with magnetic sensors placed on the wrist in order to sense single finger-tip
motion from the opposite hand \parencite{han2008}.

I don't know if I care, but \textcite{vanwest2007} created a haptic interface for manuipulating small objects with magnetic levitation.

\textcite{park2008} demonstrates a MIMO controller for a flywheel energy
storage mechanism using magnetic bearings while applying active vibration
isolation.

\textcite{tomie2005} This paper's a bit of fun; uses a magnet attached to a cantilever, excited by an external field in a water tank, to propel a robotic fish.
Only left-right oscillations were produced, so the fish was constrained to move in a plane.
