The bulk of my magnetic force code is indeed [available here](http://wspr.io/magcode).)\r\n\r\nIn the [Github repository](http://www.github.com/wspr/thesis) for this work I've started to list open [issues](http://www.github.com/wspr/thesis/issues) that I'm aware of, such as typos and (gasp) mistakes.\r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\n\r\nThe work herein is Copyright 2003--2013 Will Robertson and The University of\r\nAdelaide. **No rights are given to reproduce or modify this work.**\r\n",
