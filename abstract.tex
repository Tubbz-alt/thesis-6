\chapter{Abstract}

Vibration disturbance is a consistent complaint that will always exist to
negatively influence equipment and processes. The theme of this thesis
investigates using permanent magnets in the design of a vibration isolation
mount. Permanent magnets can be used to either support load or to reduce the
fundamental resonance frequency of a system. In the first half of the thesis,
simple permanent magnet arrangements are examined for load bearing, with
multiple designs suitable for a variety of objectives. In this vein,
electromagnetic coil forces and multipole (or Halbach) arrays of magnets are
also investigated. In the second half of the thesis, more attention is paid on
realising these systems for vibration isolation, namely, by reducing the
resonant frequency with stiffness-reducing elements. Usually these
stiffness-reducing elements are permanent magnets in attraction, but
mechanical springs are analysed briefly as well. Some different active control
techniques are investigated for further improvements to the low-frequency
isolating design. An experimental prototype tying together the major concepts
of work is shown last, demonstrating results of an permanent magnet, active,
low-frequency, vibration-isolating apparatus.
