# My thesis, before it's completed

This is an experiment. I'm hoping that by making my work on my thesis public,
my time will become more accountable by the fact that anyone will be able to
see when I am or am not working. 

I also believe that all academic research should be made more open. This is a
small step towards such a philosophy. (Making my code itself available would
be better again, but one step at a time.)

## Plagiarism

Ha! I don't even expect my *supervisors* will be looking at the work I put in
here, until I give them completed chapters to read. Besides, making the
document available will create a verifiable history; if people want to see the
work I'm doing before it's ready to be published, I admire their investigative
spirit.

There's no commercial interest in the work I'll be publishing in my thesis,
either in application or in turning the thing into a book. So there's really
no harm making the unfinished document available to anyone who cares to look.
As far as I can tell.

## LaTeX compilation

Because this document pulls information (well, mainly figures) from my actual
repository of Ph.D. work, you won't be able to compile it yourselves. Sorry.
